Chapter 4
Hearing her dear’s words while embracing his neck, she, with a slight smile, spoke to the prince, blameless.

Desiring to enlighten the prince with reason, she spoke: “Prince, listen to my words, I am not indifferent to you.”

What is most dear in the world and what is not dear? Deep thinking always does not reach an end here; this is my thought.

I have contemplated this for a long time, always due to the nature of a woman. I do not know this truth; you should tell me truly.

Thus spoken, Hemachuda, smiling, said to his dear, “Indeed, women are foolish; this is true without a doubt.”

Indeed, animals, birds, and reptiles know what is dear and not dear because it is seen in their behavior towards what is dear and not dear.

Engagement and disengagement, what is there to think much about it? Happiness makes something dear, sorrow makes something not dear.

Why do you always think with bewilderment here, dear? Hearing the dear words, Hemalekha again said to her dear,

True, women are bewildered and lack proper contemplation. Even so, I should be enlightened by you with proper contemplation.

Well enlightened by you, I will leave this worry. By you, I will always enjoy daily thereafter.

O king, indeed, happiness and sorrow become yours by determining what is dear and not dear through subtle contemplation.

Indeed, one’s happiness and sorrow are created by differences in time, place, and form. Why is that determined as the basis here?

Because fire gives different results due to differences in time, likewise, due to differences in place and form,

In cold time, fire is dear, but in heat, surely not dear. Due to differences in cold and hot places, it is dear and not dear.

For beings of cold nature, it is dear, and for others, the opposite. Thus, it is indicated with higher or lesser degrees too.

Thus, similar to cold, wealth, wives, sons, kingdom, and likewise other things, are also dear thus, even a great king surrounded by wives, sons, and wealth,

Why does he grieve daily, and why do others not grieve? This enjoyment for happiness is also an endless pursuit.

That whole happiness has not been obtained by anyone. Whatever little happiness is gained, listen about that too.

That does not become happiness, lord, when it is mixed with sorrow. But sorrow is said to be twofold: external and internal.

External sorrow arises from the body due to imbalance of elements and so on. Internal sorrow is said to be mental, arising from desire.

The greater mental suffering by which this world is grasped is indeed desire, the seed of the tree of sorrow with strong power.

By desire they serve, they have attained, doing indeed day and night, even Indra and the wise ones, dwelling in heaven, this is always known.

O prince, the happiness that remains even after the fulfillment of desire, know that as sorrow which happens even in worms.

Better is the happiness of animals, insects, worms, and so on, combined with small desires. What is the happiness of men when they have small desires, say.

If someone filled with hundreds of desires achieves something, then they would become happy here, say.

If the entire body is burned by fire, and a small drop of sandalwood paste cools it, then he also would be happy.

From the embrace of the beloved, a man gets happiness indeed. There itself, from the awkward binding of the body if separated, sorrow would be indeed.

From the intensity of pleasure, exhaustion arises in all indeed. Thereafter, fatigue is like that of a beast of burden.

How do you see that as happiness, lord? Let this be told to me, as long as happiness arises in the company of the beloved from the friction of nerves.

Is your happiness not so much, like that of dogs here? Then, indeed, exceeding that is your happiness from perceived beauty.

That arises only from ego, like in the dream, union with a woman. Long ago, a prince, more beautiful than Cupid.

A prince, more beautiful than Cupid, attained an all-enchanting woman and was extremely attached to her.

But she was attached in mind to another, a servant of the prince. The servant deceived that prince with a trick.

Giving excessive wine to him for enchanting, then sending an ugly maidservant to the intoxicated prince,

He enjoyed her, thinking her to be his wife, the world’s most beautiful. Thus, blinded by intoxication, the king’s son remained there for long.

Every day approaching the maidservant, he considered himself fortunate, “I have such a world’s most beautiful beloved.”

“I approach her daily, I have no equal anywhere.” Thus, after a long time, once by divine will,

The servant placed the drink and went to urgent duty. Then the prince drank that drink not excessively.

For that reason, he quickly went, his mind eager for pleasure, to the bed, mentally delightful, endowed with all prosperity of enjoyments.

The palace like that of the lord of gods situated in Nandana, he approached the maidservant on the bed, thinking her to be the princess.

Overwhelmed by the force of desire, he enjoyed with extreme pleasure. Then, discovering at the end of the pleasure, her to be maidservant with a distorted appearance,

Suspicious and indignant, thinking “What is this?” and “Where is my beloved?” he asked her in this way.

Being questioned thus by him, the maidservant, observing him sober, indeed frightened, not speaking anything, trembling then, thereafter,

Noticing the trouble and self-deception, the prince, with red eyes of anger, grabbed the maidservant’s hair with his left hand.

Taking the sword with his right hand, the prince, threatening her, said, “Speak the event as it happened.”

“Otherwise, your life will not last even for a moment.” Thus, hearing his words, frightened with the desire to save her life,

She told everything as it has happened for a long time and also showed him his wife’s association with the servant.

Somewhere on the ground, lying was the servant, dark with brown eyes, tall with dirty limbs, and a harsh, disgusting face.

Embracing her, exhausted from pleasure with all limbs in a feeling of love, his neck surrounded by her soft arms, his own wife,

Placing his face like a lotus in her feet, embracing tightly, her pair of thighs attached to his hands, her heavy breasts,

The prince saw her like a spring creeper covered with clusters of flowers, like Rohini attacked by Rahu.

Seeing her in this way, unconscious by sleep, extremely deluded, for a moment, thereafter attaining composure,

What the prince spoke, hear from me indeed. Shame on me, extremely ignoble, foolish, intoxicated, and deluded.

Shame on those deeply attached to women, shame on those lowest of men. Women are not anyone’s, like starlings on a tree.

What will I say about myself, foolish like a calf of a buffalo, knowing her, thinking her dearer than life, as my beloved for a long time?

Women are not anyone’s, like a prostitute to a rogue. Indeed, who is confident in women is like a wild donkey.

The state of an autumn cloud is momentary and unstable. Even more flimsy is the extremely fickle state of women.

Alas, till today, I did not know the nature of women. Abandoning me, who was wholly attached to her, she devoted herself to a servant.

Attached to another, greedy in mind, showing insincere love for me, displaying her own devotion like an actress in an actor’s troupe.

With mind intoxicated by wine, I did not know her even a bit, thinking she was attached to me like a shadow, confident trusting her in mind.

Certainly, who on earth would be more foolish than me, deceived and long-associated with that unattractive maidservant?

Who thus, with confidence, was long deceived by her. Alas, this wretched servant with a distorted form,

What beauty was seen in this by her, more than everywhere, even if my own beauty was taken as world-watching.

Entirely attached to the servant, abandoning him, she approached. Thus, lamenting variously, extremely disillusioned then,

The prince went to the forest, free from all attachments. Therefore, O prince, this beauty arises from the mind.

As you formerly found extreme pleasure in me, seeing my extreme beauty, likewise, especially that,

Many find extreme pleasure even in deformed women. Here, I will give you assurance. Listen attentively, dear.

A woman is seen externally well-formed, but that is also a reflection of her own self-form, residing in the mind.

Her beauty is drawn in the mind in the form of desire, repeatedly. After that, achieving the desire.

A man with agitated senses obtains pleasure in her everywhere. But with unagitated senses, there would not be pleasure even in beauty.

There, the repeated description of her beauty again and again is the root of agitation. But this agitation is not seen in children, not even in yogis.

Similarly, whoever finds pleasure in whom, a man describes beauty there, in a beautiful one or another.

Women with extremely ugly forms are seen, associated with young men for the sake of children.

If there is a description of deformity or non-description of beauty, how would men find pleasure in both indeed?

What is to be said, alas, of men with lustful, distracted minds? Beauty shines more everywhere, even in inferior parts.

If one sees beauty in parts smeared with filth and urine, where would one not see beauty shining then?

Therefore, this beauty, indeed, O prince, observe. Without pride, it would not be the cause of happiness anywhere.

If beauty in the body is like the sweetness of honey, then why does it not shine in children or boys like that?

In different regions, various forms of men are seen: one-legged, one-eyed, long-eared, horse-faced.

Ear-covered, forehead-faced, protruding teeth, without nose, long-nosed, covered with hair, reverse-haired.

With tawny hair, white hair, disheveled hair, thick hair, leprosy spots, crow-colored, yellowish, and reddish-bodied.

Thus, various mortals find pleasure among women of the same species, like you, O prince, observe.

In sources of pleasure, the main one is the female form, dear to all, where all, even the wise ones, are deluded.

Likewise, consider the form of men and women, extremely beautiful and dear, with good intellect, as it is, O prince.

Smeared with flesh, soaked in blood, bound by veins, covered with skin, a skeleton covered with hair, filled with bile and phlegm.

Filled with filth and urine, born of semen and blood, arising from the urinary passage, alas, this is desired here.

Men who indulge in pleasure in such extremely repulsive conditions, tell me, where is their difference from worms in excrement?

O prince, this body is extremely dear to you. Consider with discernment the separate existence of its elements.

Thus, consider the nature of sweet, sour, etc. similarly, six tastes elsewhere to be used, indeed, see with subtle vision.

Even of all that is eaten, its transformation into excrement is realized by all in every way, indeed without doubt.

Tell me, thus established in the world, what would be dear and what not dear? Thus spoken, Hemacuda then realized indifference in the subject.

Hearing the unprecedented speech, he became immediately astonished, reflecting again on all that was said by Hemalekha.

With disinterest in pleasures arisen, he attained supreme detachment. Then, gradually asking her, his beloved, and knowing that state,

Realizing the consciousness established in the self, Tripura in the form of the self, he became a liberated soul, seeing everything as self.

He became liberated while living. Then, his younger brother Manicuda also realized, from his brother, then Muktacuda also from his son.

Manicuda’s beloved also attained knowledge from the daughter-in-law. Ministers and citizens also became full of knowledge.

No one was born ignorant in that city. It became known as Brahma’s city, an abode of peaceful cycles of birth and death.

That great city appeared very excellent in the world, where parrots and mynah birds recited in cages, indeed.

Worship your own self as the form of consciousness, without awareness. There is no other awareness apart from consciousness, like a mirror’s reflection.

Consciousness, awareness, I am consciousness, all moving and non-moving, since all follows consciousness and shines, indeed, independently.

Therefore, people, all worship the shining, all-pervading consciousness, abandoning delusion, with clear vision of pure consciousness.

Once, hearing the magnificent speech of the parrots, the Brahmins, starting with Vamadeva, announced the name of the city.

Because here even the animals recite knowledge, therefore, let this city be renowned by the name “Famous City of Knowledge.”

Even today, that city is established by that name. O Rama, therefore, indeed, association with the good is the root for all auspiciousness.

By the association with Hemalekha, all became knowledgeable. Therefore, O Rama, know that association is the supreme root for prosperity.

Thus ends the fourth chapter on the Fruit of Association with the Good in the Story of Hemachuda in the Knowledge Section of the revered Tripura Rahasya.
