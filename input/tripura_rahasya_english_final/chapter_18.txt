Chapter 18
O Bhārgava, thus indeed that consciousness is described as objectless. The states of its realization are heard in many ways, indeed.

People deluded by illusion do not know due to lack of discernment. That state is realized by subtle vision, indeed, not otherwise, anywhere.

What use is much talking to you, O Rāma? Listen, I speak the essence. The object is known by the mind; therefore, the mind is not known.

Thus, the mind also, free from objects, could be. That mind, free from objects, is called awareness.

By the nature of realization, that is always known indeed. Dependence on other realizations would be blindness from instability.

O Bhārgava, how do you see any object, yet do not shine? If you do not shine, then how is your question?

Oh, being like a sky-flower, how do you desire benefit? How can I help your self? Reflect on this.

If you say you do not know me generally shining specifically, O Rāma, indeed your form is general and unchanging.

Without a trace of specificity, this much indeed is your form. Oh, knowing even, you are very much confused again in vain.

The illuminator of everything may be a specific object; therefore, by yourself, you shine as a general form, indeed.

If you shine by body, etc., as self, listen, I tell you: you shine as the body-self by conception, indeed, not otherwise.

Consider with subtle vision, in the conception of another as body, whether it appears as your bodiness; and that body also becomes yours.

Thus, whatever body is conceived, that indeed becomes yours; by that, you would be all-pervading. How could you be only the body-self?

Therefore, your visible form would not be by variation. Therefore, you are of the form of pure seeing, not ever the seer or seen.

That self-luminous form, devoid of any trace of distinction, is filled with manifold diversity of body, place, time, and differences.

Therefore, by abandoning conception alone, perceive the form of your own self, remaining beyond, situated in pure consciousness.

Thus, once perceived, that which is situated without attribute, that ignorance, the cause of all transmigration, dissolves.

Liberation is not in the sky, netherworld, or on earth; it is indeed the manifestation of the pure self by abandoning conception.

That is never unattained by being the self-nature; only by the removal of mere delusion is fulfillment.

Another liberation, separate from the self-nature, is not conceivable, as it would be perishable due to being created; indeed, it would be like a hare's horn.

The own nature being completely full, where can another liberation happen? Liberation arising in one's own nature is like a reflection in a mirror.

Even in the world, liberation without the disappearance of bondage is not conceived. The disappearance would indeed be non-existence; how can the real be of the nature of non-existence?

An entity of the nature of existence and non-existence is not possible anywhere. Thus, dream states are of the nature of both existence and non-existence.

If they are real, the cause of negation would indeed make them unreal. Listen: negation is the notion of non-existence, which occurs in the absence of the notion.

That which is associated with negation is unreal, indeed not otherwise. Negation exists for all visible things in the absence of the notion.

Therefore, it would indeed be unreal, established as the nature of existence and non-existence, whose touch of non-existence is never anywhere.

Thus, the nature of consciousness, true in all respects, is established. Therefore, separate liberation would not be true at all.

Liberation of the complete self is said to be its own manifestation. By mere abandonment of objects, consciousness is proclaimed as full.

The manifestation of objects indeed is the contraction of consciousness. In the absence of objects, consciousness is full by the absence of limitation.

If limitation by time, etc., is defined for that, tell whether the limitation would be by the non-conscious or by the conscious.

By the non-conscious, indeed, it would be unreal; by the conscious, that indeed is pervasive. In the world, any entity conceived as limited by time.

When entity and time attain the state of being limited and unlimited, then consciousness indeed would be pervasive in such.

When consciousness is not pervasive, how would limitation be established? When an object is outside of consciousness, that would be limitation.

The establishment of objects outside of consciousness is not appropriate in any way. How would that which is outside be established, devoid of connection with consciousness?

Even connection would not be partial; otherwise, it would be unreal. Mere connection with that part, from appearance, other is not established.

Therefore, the object outside should be considered immersed in consciousness. Thus, in all respects, the object indeed should be considered immersed.

How would the object, completely immersed in its own interior, be self-limiting? O Rama, consider logically such an object.

The object appearing within consciousness would be like a reflection. The object within the interior of the object is not clearly seen in the world.

If the objects indeed would be mixed, O Rama, in all respects, the external object stated by you is indeed based on illusion.

Tell, how would the reality of objects dependent on that be? The nature of consciousness, indeed one's own self, is always as the essence of those objects.

It appears by its own free power, and nothing more exists anywhere. Hearing this statement, Bhārgava asked again.

O Lord, what you said appears difficult to me. The pure consciousness appearing as varied is impossible.

Consciousness and object are conceived as twofold entities by all. There, the object is illumined by consciousness, and consciousness is self-luminous to you.

Just as an object illumined by light is indeed separate from it, thus, the object illumined by consciousness is distinct.

The object being of the nature of consciousness is not an experience. Moreover, it was previously said by the great soul, Janaka.

By abandonment of thoughts, the mind indeed becomes without duality. That same non-dual state becomes the knowledge that destroys worldly existence.

That is indeed said to be the form of the self. How would that be? For the mind is indeed said to be the instrument of the self in knowledge and action.

If the mind is not of the self, how would it be distinguished from the inert? O Lord, indeed, the mind's difference from the inert is due to the self.

For indeed, bondage and liberation of the self are clearly by the mind. The mind with duality is bondage, and liberation is without duality.

How is the mind itself the self, when the mind is considered an instrument? Even in the perfection of the non-dual, duality remains.

Even if seen in the world, one whose delusion is non-existent, indeed he, not by falsehood is delusion, how would that be non-duality?

Utility is not corrupted anywhere by a false object. All worldly objects indeed are stable and utility-producing.

Tell, how is that falsehood established as non-duality? All delusive knowledge and the distinction between delusion and non-delusion, how is it?

Tell me, O teacher, how can delusion be all-pervading? This doubt has been revolving in my heart for a long time.

Thus, hearing this question, the all-knowing Dattatreya, delighted by the good question, commenced to speak.

O Rāma, well done, this question is often asked. Until the mind is satisfied, one should keep clarifying.

How would a teacher say what is in the mind if unasked? Indeed, due to differences in intellect, reasoning is established differently among beings.

Without asking one's own opinion, who is freed from doubt? Indeed, the question is the seed of firm knowledge for the questioner in clarification.

Without asking, knowledge would not be at all. Having asked, one would know from the teacher. Thus, consciousness, though one only, may appear due to variety.

Just as a mirror of one form appears in many ways from reflections, see in dreams and imaginations, the mind is indeed one only.

Thus, consciousness shines through the diversity of seer, seeing, and seen. Indeed, she is pure and illuminates various forms.

Consciousness and the perceived appear as duality even in dreams. Without light, the blind surely do not know existence.

The form appearing to the blind shines only in memory. Without the light of consciousness, when and where does anything shine?

Just as without a mirror, no reflection shines, so too, from the mirror, the reflection is not separate.

Thus, without consciousness, nothing separate is known. Therefore, the mind is not other than consciousness in any way.

Just as the mind is in dreams, so too in waking, the mind is not different. The mind is merely an instrument imagined for the completion of actions.

Just as a dream axe is an instrument for cutting trees, O Rāma, actions are false forms; how can that instrument be true?

Who has ever been well-cut by a man's horn, a false thing? Therefore, O Rāma, the mind, too, is not the cause of false action.

In dreams, the mind is said to be the instrument for vision, action, and other activities. Just as in dreams, so always, the mind is not the doer of actions.

Consciousness, pure and free, imagines the mind and other instruments, and engages in activities through the diversity of the seen and the seer.

Sometimes, sometimes only, it is established in non-duality. Listen, O Bhārgava, the nature of consciousness, even when full, itself.

Not like space, consciousness is self-illuminating, thus established. Space and the consciousness-self are  not distinct from each other.

Full, subtle, pure, unborn, infinite, formless, the support of all, unattached, the self, being inside and outside all.

There is no distinction in consciousness and space; in reality, the self, full of consciousness, is indeed called space.

Indeed, there is no difference between the self and space, even a little. What is space is indeed the self; and what is the self is indeed space.

The ignorant see the nature of the self as space, indeed, from delusion, just as an owl sees only darkness in sunlight.

But the wise see space as the essence of self-consciousness. The supreme consciousness, the supreme lord, pure and free in splendor.

Illuminates the self as limited in many ways, just as, O Rāma, one sees oneself in dreams in many ways, separately.

You illuminate through distinctions of humans, etc., thus indeed. Even the illumination in many ways is surely by limited vision.

By one's own vision, the supreme consciousness is indeed in the form of the complete self. Even a magician, though one, sees oneself in many ways.

Illuminating there, the supreme consciousness shines by the vision of the seers, itself indeed one and changeless.

Even the pure, one form shines in many limited ways, covered by illusion.

This illusion's cover comes of limited vision, as a magician covered by illusion appears differently.

Illusion created by others, extremely difficult to overcome, even in the world, yogis, others adept in mantras, and magicians.

Covering their own freedom, attaining something with proper reasoning, they accomplish difficult tasks, thus this is not very surprising.

Thus, O son of Bhṛgu, from the pure freedom of the supreme consciousness, the form of one's self shines in many limited ways.

Limitation of ego is well established in one place, which is also famous as incompleteness, described as ignorance.

Here many logicians and scholars are deluded, not realizing their own self, being with outward vision.

Anything taught by the guru, whether true or untrue, one does not realize until they realize their own self.

Until then, one does not obtain the fruit by indirect knowledge from scripture. Therefore, O Rāma, I have said, you see within yourself with true vision.

The supreme consciousness, which is the goddess of all common forms, is full of light and separate from inertness.

Therefore, the rest in one's own self is indeed the ego in another form. The inert rested in the consciousness self shines in the self of consciousness.

Not shining in its own form by itself, therefore, there is no rest in the own self. The consciousness indeed only rests in itself always without any dependence.

Due to shining in itself, rest occurs. This supreme complete ego, which does not exist in the inert, is this.

Without touch of distinction, due to the absence of limitation, everything is established in this, like a city in a mirror.

How can distinction or limitation occur, indeed, by whom? Thus, the complete form's complete shining is established.

That indeed is said to be rest in one's own self and complete ego. This unbroken one essence indeed becomes as much, O Rāma.

In description, that appears in many forms, as much indeed is the freedom, since the power is that indeed.

Just as light and heat of fire exist inseparably, thus freedom and rest together are of one essence.

This indeed is the power called illusion, extremely difficult, which in form is like a mirror, of one essence with consciousness.

Even though appearing in many variations, the true form shines. Similarly, during shining, there is no deviation from the true form.

The appearance of limitation, which is said to be the appearance of the non-self, is ignorance, the inert power, the void, and nature.

Complete non-existence, space, darkness, the first creation, all that indeed is said to be the primary limitation.

O Rāma, the complete self, indeed, rests established. The misconception of partiality creates the appearance of space.

Therefore, the space of the self, which is devoid of self-conception, is said to be space. Indeed, that is the cause of samsara.

This indeed would be the distinction visible to the limited vision. O Rāma, with subtle vision, see the space that is seen by you.

The self of the collection of beings there is pure consciousness, as the space appears in other bodies, which is always your own.

That indeed would be their self, of the nature of dense consciousness and bliss. Thus, the form of consciousness remains pervaded by self-created space.

That indeed is called the mind, said to be the self, not otherwise. There, due to the primary nature of covering, the mind is called proof.

Due to the primary nature of covering, the knower is called the individual self. Thus, even though covered by space, the consciousness-self is indeed again.

In the soft, extremely loose, non-dense, pure space, through imaginations of hard and attached, dense and impure.

Reflecting elements, the embodied self, also covered by the body, shines like a lamp placed inside a pot, pervading the inside.

Thus, this only reflecting the inner body remains, like a hidden lamp, only illuminating the inside.

As the lamp's light goes out through the pot's hole, indeed, thus, consciousness goes out again through the openings of the senses.

Indeed, going out of consciousness does not exist due to its completeness and non-action. The self-covering space, the power of manifestation, is of the consciousness-self.

As long as one restrains, until then, the going out appears. This would be mental activity, the removal of the covering by manifestation.

Therefore, O Rāma, the mind is not different, indeed the self is called the mind. The moving consciousness named as mind, in the form of the unmoving self.

The removal of the covering by manifestation, indeed the movement of consciousness, O Rāma, this indeed would be imagination, in the absence of imagination.

Free from imagination, the complete form of knowledge, called liberation. O Rāma, abandon doubt here, in the absence of imagination.

Even the remaining covering would not exist, thus indeed, the covering is not true, because it is indeed imagined by oneself.

As in a fantasy, bound by some enemy, oneself being beaten and threatened, until imagination ceases.

Until then, the beating or threatening ceases; what remains there of bondage? Similarly, consider here also.

From beginningless time, O Rāma, here bondage does not exist for anyone. Giving up the delusion of a material self, consider what is this bondage.

This indeed is the great bondage, the certainty of bondage's reality. Like the false demon possession of a frightened child, it is situated.

As long as this delusion of bondage is not given up, even a wise person is not liberated from transmigration anywhere, despite great efforts.

What is this bondage, or how would it exist for the pure consciousness-self, conceived internally by reflections in the mirror of one's own self?

If bondage were like a fire reflection in a mirror that would burn, then belief in the reality of bondage and the certainty of the mind's existence would be true.

Without these two things, bondage does not exist for anyone anywhere. As long as these two things are sufficiently washed away by the great waters of true reflection.

Until then, without being washed away, in the destruction of transmigration, neither I, nor Brahma, nor Vishnu, nor Shankara.

Neither the embodiment of knowledge nor Tripura is capable by any means. Therefore, O Rāma, giving up these two, be happy.

Therefore, O Rāma, in the mind established in the form of non-duality, by the nature of the self alone, duality does not remain.

From the mind not shining in the form of "this" and "that," in giving up "this" and "that," the essence of shining alone remains.

The confusion of the rope and snake, considered true, in the form of the rope, indeed, the snake appears; thus, it is certain.

There, even in the negation of the snake, because of the support of the rope, from the form of consciousness, but other than the self, the knowledge of the rope would be established.

When the rope itself is imagined as a dream example of consciousness, in the negation of the rope, indeed, how would that knowledge remain, with what support?

Therefore, in the negation of the visible, that knowledge only remains as seeing. Because of non-separation from the consciousness-self, by that, how would there be duality?

Indeed, practical activity is seen as stable in dream objects. Dream objects are considered stable by all in a dream.

This much indeed is the difference in the perceptions of dream and waking: In waking, the certainty of the dream's falseness becomes definite.

In a dream, the certainty of the waking's falseness does not arise. This much alone would not determine the reality of waking activity.

As in waking, the stability and practical activity of objects are seen, is it seen thus in a dream or not? Tell.

In a dream, waking states do not appear, and dream states do not appear in waking. Practical activity or stability also do not appear similarly.

Consider with subtle vision, what is the difference between past and dream? See the stability and practical activity created by magic.

What, then, is only true, created by magic? The distinction between true and false is not known by ordinary people.

Therefore, the deluded ones say the world is true. O Rama, they declare it to be true, untouched by non-existence at any time.

Non-existence would be from non-appearance, indeed, but non-appearance is never of consciousness anywhere. Non-appearance is of the insentient, indeed, from the appearance of multiplicity.

Insentient states always appear as mutual non-existence. O Rama, consider when and where the non-appearance of consciousness would be.

When consciousness does not appear, then how would it appear? Tell. If it does not appear, how would it appear in non-appearance of the two?

O Rama, consciousness indeed appears; therefore, it is true. O Rama, listen, I briefly tell the distinction between true and false.

What appears independently would be true; other things would be false. Otherwise, the rope-snake and the like would also be true, indeed.

Negation, indeed, is knowledge of non-existence, and it would happen in its existence. In non-existence, knowledge of existence also happens clearly.

Therefore, the view that what is not negated is true and what is negated is false is not reasonable due to inconsistency in all ways.

In the non-appearance of consciousness, nothing would be, and that also would not be in all ways. Therefore, the logician mule who would say that consciousness does not appear...

He would say, "I am not." Thus, there, by whom, what is said? Whose doubt in the self would always be by the non-appearance of consciousness?

He would destroy the delusion of others by skillful arguments. Then, this rock would also destroy another's delusion.

Therefore, by the mere appearance of practical activity, there is not truth. All knowledge indeed is delusion, no doubt.

This great delusion in them is the certainty of non-delusion. Indeed, as delusion would first be from the knowledge of negation, thus.

All worldly knowledge is established as if non-delusion. Indeed, as the knowledge of silver from the knowledge of shell is of the nature of delusion.

Thus, from the knowledge of the consciousness self, all knowledge is of the nature of delusion. The delusion of the blue sky appears similarly to all.

This delusion of the waking state would be the cause of defects for all. Non-delusion, pure knowledge, is established as the consciousness self.

Thus, this which was asked by you has been spoken, consistent with reason. O Rama, abandon doubt here and determine what has been spoken.

How is the conduct of the liberated? This was asked before. I will explain that to you, O Rama. Listen attentively with concentration.

The liberated wise in the world are of three types: best, worst, and middling. They are afflicted moment by moment by experiences due to past karma.

Those who know their true nature, O Rama, are considered dull-witted if they do not recognize what comes from past karma even while experiencing it.

The middling wise are considered like those intoxicated by the taste of honey. They, too, are influenced by the varied fruits of numerous past actions.

They do not deviate from their true nature, nor are they perturbed by groups of calamities. They are neither amazed by wonders nor do they rejoice in great pleasures.

The best among the wise are inwardly peaceful and outwardly ordinary. Thus, by the difference in intellect and maturity of knowledge...

Due to the grandeur of remaining prārabdha, their conduct is varied. Their conduct may happen like that of one intoxicated by honey.

Thus ends the eighteenth chapter named "Knowledge Section" in the revered Tripura Rahasya.
