Chapter 13
The sage's son, again at the exit from the mountain, made Mahasena unconscious with the subtle body consisting of impressions.

Taking him out, he placed him into that body and revived him, fitting him well into the worn-out body.

Then, Mahasena, risen, observed the external world, the land, people, trees, streams, and ponds, all new.

Greatly astonished, he asked the sage's son, "Which world is this, O great one, that you have shown to me?"

"Explain this unprecedented, wonderful world," asked Mahasena. The sage's son said to him:

"Listen, O king, this world, which we inhabited before, has indeed undergone a transformation over a long time."

"One day in the mountain world, for us, indeed, here corresponds to twelve crores of years in time."

"Thus, this world has passed and attained a different form. See the different customs and languages everywhere."

"In the same way, people's conditions change with time. Thus, I have seen many different world conditions."

"See, this is my revered father with a composed mind. This is the place where you praised my father before."

"See this great mountain where my world is observed. Thousands of your brother's subjects have passed away."

"The city named Sundara in Vanga country, which was yours before, has now become a forest filled with wild beasts."

"Your brother's descendant, known as Virabahu, is immediately the king of Malwa, in the city named Vishala on the banks of Kshipra."

"Your descendant named Susharma became a king in Dravida, in the city named Vardhana on the banks of the Tamraparni river."

"The condition of this world always changes thus, and in a short time, it became this new world."

"From now, in a long time, mountains, rivers, ponds, lands will change; thus indeed is the world condition."

"Mountains go lower, lowlands become high; desert lands become wetlands, mountains become sandy."

"Hard earth, mostly rocky, becomes very soft; soft earth also becomes like stone sometimes."

"Barren land becomes fertile, fertile land becomes barren; gems become gravel, and gravel has the essence of gems."

"Saline water becomes sweet, sweet water becomes saline; sometimes there is an abundance of people, sometimes an abundance of animals."

"Sometimes, the world is seen abundant with worms and insects. Thus, this world changes differently due to differences in time."

"Therefore, this world was indeed such as ours before." Thus, hearing the words of the sage's son, the king...

Mahasena, overwhelmed with extreme sorrow, fainted. Consoled by the sage's son, the king attained wisdom.

Overwhelmed with extreme sorrow, he lamented like a very miserable person, for his brother, brother's sons, and his own wives.

Remembering his sons and others separately, he lamented extremely sorrowfully. Then, as he was lamenting for his brother and others from delusion, immediately...

The sage's son, with the intention of enlightening the king, said, "O king, you are indeed intelligent. Whom and why do you lament?"

"Intelligent ones indeed never do fruitless actions. Whoever does actions without considering the result is foolish."

"Why do you lament the truth? Tell me, for what reason indeed is your lamentation?" Thus addressed, the extremely sorrowful king Mahasena said to him:

"Why do you not see the place of my sorrow, O great sage? Why do you ask the reason for the one whose all is destroyed?"

"Even in one person's destruction, there would be sorrow altogether for the world. Why do you ask again when total destruction is present?"

Thus addressed, the sage's son also said again, as if smiling, "O king, tell me, what is this eternal family duty of yours?"

"If not lamenting would result in great sin, or otherwise, if the lost is obtained again by lamenting, then..."

"O king, consider with courage, what result would come from lamenting? If lost relatives should be lamented, then listen..."

"Past relatives, lost, including ancestors and others, indeed should always be lamented. Why were they not lamented previously?"

"Then, whose are your relatives, and where is your relationship with them? They are like worms in the excrement of your mother, father, or oneself, indeed."

"Countless worms born from one's body and connected to it are not considered your relatives. Why and where are they not lamented?"

"O king, consider who you are, and whom you lament as lost. Are you the body, separate from the body, or the body in conglomerate form?"

"The destruction of one part of a conglomerate is called destruction. Every moment, the body undergoes part-by-part destruction."

"The decline of urine, excretion, mucus, nails, hair, etc., continually occurs. Indeed, the complete destruction of the conglomerate is not observed."

"A part of your brother's body is clearly in the elements like earth, etc. Ultimately, the body-space is only indestructible."

"You are not the body, but the possessor of the body. Just as you say 'my body,' similarly, how can you be the body?"

"If you are separate from the body, what connection do you have with other bodies? Just as there is no relationship with the garments of brothers."

"How can you lament the destroyed bodies due to non-difference? My body, my senses, my life, my mind, thus you are."

"O king, tell me your true essence," he said to Mahasena. Addressed thus, Mahasena deeply reflected for a moment.

Unable to answer the sage's question, very distressed, Mahasena said, "O lord, I do not know who I am completely."

"Naturally, I lament without knowing the reason. I have surrendered to you, O lord, distressed. Tell me what this is."

"All lament for any dead relative. They do not know their self and certainly do not lament for others."

"O lord, tell this clearly to your disciple," Mahasena asked. Then the sage's son spoke to Mahasena.

"O king, listen. Deluded by Mahadevi's illusion, people always lament uselessly without knowing their self."

"Until the true essence of the self is known, people certainly lament. Knowing it, they do not lament anywhere again."

"Just as oneself deluded by sleep laments without knowing itself, a man deluded by a magician's spell laments by illusion."

"Just as one laments by the fear of a snake created by illusion, thus, deluded by illusion, one laments without knowing oneself."

"Just as one awakened from a dream or knowing a magician's spell does not lament anywhere and laughs at others in grief."

"Thus, knowers of the self, freed from illusion, do not lament anywhere and laugh at those like you deluded by illusion."

"Knowing the true essence of the self, crossing the difficult illusion, destroy grief arising from delusion through true reflection, O mighty-armed one."

Thus addressed, Mahasena again said to the sage, "O lord, the example you stated is indeed difficult."

"The dream or illusory world appears to have a void nature, but this waking world is real and fulfills all purposes."

"How can the uncontradicted and stable waking world be like a dream?" Thus addressed, the very wise sage's son again explained.

"Listen, O king, to what you stated, that the example is difficult. This is your second delusion, like a dream within a dream."

"Does not even a dream tree at that time provide benefit to travelers and remove their heat by providing shade?"

"Does the dream satisfy the dream and mortal beings by fruits and others? Where is the obstruction in the dream, and how is it observed as stable?"

"If you say the entire dream is obstructed in the waking state, listen: is not the entire waking world obstructed in deep sleep?"

"If you say it is not obstructed the next day due to continuation, then where is the continuation of the dream the next day?"

"If you say there is no continuation in the dream, O king, listen: where is the appearance of continuation in the new experience in waking?"

"If you say the continuation appears elsewhere in the new experience, listen: thus, in the dream, too, the continuation appears indeed in the stable appearance."

"If you say there is false continuation in the dream, thus, in waking, too, it is so. Consider with a subtle intellect that thing established in waking."

"The body, tree, river, lamp, and so on are momentarily different. How can that continuation indeed be of true essence?"

"Even immovable things are not connected to the next moment; their form is always fragmented by streams."

"Mountains are always fragmented by mice, insects, boars, streams, and others from all sides."

"Mountains, oceans, and the earth even are momentarily changing. Now I will explain to you; observe with a subtle intellect, O king."

"The limited continuation in dreams and waking is indeed the same, while the unlimited continuation in actions is extremely rare."

"Continuation always exists by cause and form. If so, the cause is certainly consisting of earth and others."

"That continuation is also observed in the dream due to the appearance of earth and others. Now, the obstruction of the dream is experienced in waking."

"The obstruction of waking does not appear to anyone anywhere. If so, listen, I will explain: obstruction is indeed non-appearance."

"In deep sleep, the non-appearance of the entire world is experienced. Now, if obstruction is indeed the absence of perception, then listen."

"The absence of perception does not exist for the deluded like you, indeed. For those who know the truth, the absence of perception is clear."

"Therefore , this network of perceptions is in the same state as dream perception. A long duration appears in the dream without distinction."

"Therefore, the unobstructed, functioning, and stable dream state is similar to the waking state in every way."

"As the waking state is clearly grasped in waking, the waking state is also grasped in the dream like that."

"Thus established, where is the distinction, O king, between dream and waking? Then, why do you not grieve for your own relatives in the dream?"

"In this world, reality is established by mere thought. By thinking of emptiness, it also becomes emptiness without resistance."

"Indeed, thought stabilized by the absence of validation becomes the truth by its own nature, O king."

"Indeed, if you have seen my world as an example here, after circumambulating this mountain, come, and we shall see it now."

Thus having said, he took the king by hand and circumambulated the mountain, arriving there together with the king.

Again, the wise son of the sage spoke to Mahasena: "O king, see this mountain extending a couple of miles."

"Indeed, seen in its womb, your world is widely and clearly displayed. Is this waking or a dream, true or false?"

"In the mountain world, one day is here experienced as twelve million years. Discern whether this is true or false."

"There is no distinction between this and different dreams. From this, know that the essence of the world is thought alone."

"This unreal world dissolves in a moment. Therefore, abandon grief, O king, understanding that the world is like a dream."

"Considering yourself as a dream-picture on the wall, consciousness in essence, a reflection like in a mirror, so you are situated."

"Know the waking state as a picture in a mirror, and yourself as consciousness in essence. Become supremely blissful in heart quickly, O king."

Thus ends the thirteenth chapter named "Observing the World of Shailaloka" in the revered Knowledge Section of Tripura Rahasya.
