Chapter 1
Om, salutations to the one who is the cause of bliss, the supreme consciousness, who shines in the universe like a mirror.

O Narada, have you heard with an attentive mind, the greatness of the one named Tripura, which the scripture declares as the supreme means?

Today I will tell you great and wonderful knowledge, which upon hearing, a human being will never experience grief again.

Considering thoroughly the Vedic, Vaishnava, Shaiva, Shakta, and Pashupata knowledge, this conclusion has been reached.

Nothing else like this knowledge should occupy the mind. This was established to Bhargava by the Guru Środatta.

Accompanied by reasons and realizations, much adorned, even by what is said here, one cannot know if the mind is bewildered.

He is simply struck by fate, like an immovable post, without a doubt. He does not have any knowledge, even if it is directly defined by Shiva.

Listen, I will explain it to you as it stands in the form of knowledge. Indeed, the conduct of the virtuous is wonderfully remarkable and full of superior qualities.

Even this divine sage desires to hear something from me, though he is indifferent. This benevolence is naturally born among the good.

Just as the natural attraction of the deer towards the scent of musk is inherent, similarly, upon hearing from Dattatreya's mouth the grandeur of his greatness...

Rama, the delight of all people, the son of Jamadagni, of good intent, with his heart captivated by devotion, became somewhat silent.

Then, having expressed his state of mind, his eyes filled with joy, his body thrilled, full, and his inner self filled with bliss.

Joy arising, as if emerging by piercing his hair follicles, he bowed to Guru Dattatreya like a stick near his feet.

Rising, filled with joy, he spoke with a choked sweet voice, "I am blessed, I am accomplished, O revered Guru, by your grace."

My Guru, directly Shiva, an ocean of compassion, is pleased. When he is pleased, even the position of Brahma would be like grass.

Even death attains self-realization from the pleased Guru. Indeed, without any reason, my Guru Maheshvara is pleased today.

I believe that I have attained everything indeed by the grace of the Guru. O master, I have now heard the entire greatness by your grace.

I wish to worship Tripura, the supreme goddess. O Guru, kindly tell me the method of that worship.

Thus requested, Guru Dattatreya, seeing Bhargava's fitness, enhanced by true faith and devotion, for the worship of Tripura.

Gradually, he initiated him for the worship of Tripura. The son of Jamadagni, having received the auspicious initiation of Tripura.

Surpassing all initiations, with the complete awakening of the truth, accompanied by mantra and yantra practices, the entire process.

Having received nectar from the lotus-like face of the revered Guru, like a bee, satisfied in his inner self, Bhargava then filled with bliss.

Permitted by the revered Guru, prepared for the worship of Tripura, having circumambulated the Guru and bowing, he went to Mahendra mountain.

There, creating an auspicious and very blissful residence, he became devoted to worship for twelve years.

Devoted to daily and occasional duties, always dedicated to worship and chanting, exclusively devoted to the meditation of Tripureshanya.

Thus, his twelve years passed like a moment. Then, once comfortably seated, the son of Jamadagni thought.

Previously, what Samvarta said, earnestly requested by me on the path, that indeed was not known by me even in part.

Forgotten by me, therefore, I previously asked the Guru about the greatness of Tripura Shakti, which I heard from the mouth of the revered Guru.

However, what Samvarta had said earlier, I did not understand at all. I had asked the Guru something about the topic of creation.

Then, narrating the story of the battle, the Guru did not say to me, out of context, that which remained.

I do not even know the slightest bit about the movement of this world. Why has this vast spectacle of the universe arisen?

Where does it go again? Where does it attain a stable position? But I see everything unstable everywhere.

Conduct generally stable, why is this also such? I see strange worldly behavior without reflection.

Oh, as the blind followed by the blind indeed act in that manner, the behavior of the world is observed to be the same for all.

Indeed, my self-action here would be an example in all ways. Surely, what happened in my childhood, that I do not remember.

In boyhood, behavior was different, and in youth also different, now, indeed, my activity is different in all ways.

I do not know at all what has become of their actions, in any way whatsoever, in whatever way, at whatever time, and by whomever they are done.

Having understood it rightly, with prior consideration of the consequences, what outcome has been attained there? By whom has happiness been achieved for the self?

Whatever action in this world is examined as having consequences like fruit, that examination indeed is the fruit. I do not consider that examination as the fruit, when that action is done again by the same person.

When the result is attained, how does one desire another result again, tell me. Because all people always act with a desire for the result.

It is indeed that result which has been mentioned: the alleviation of suffering or happiness. In the distinction of duties, there is neither the cessation of suffering nor merely happiness alone.

Duty itself is said to be the supreme sorrow of sorrows. But in its existence, how are you to have the absence of sorrow or happiness?

Just as applying a bandage to the entire body of one burned all over is described here as the gain of happiness from the performance of one’s duty.

Just as the embrace of groups of apsaras for a person whose heart is pierced by arrows, thus is the gain of happiness here said from the performance of one’s duty.

Just as the hearing of a song for a person afflicted by the disease of consumption of poison, thus is the gain of happiness here said from the performance of one’s duty.

Happy indeed are those in the worlds who are without duty, dwelling under trees, the great souls, whose all bodies are very cool.

If someone somewhere could find happiness in the performance of one’s duty, then even a man with a spear wound could find happiness in fragrant garlands.

Oh, what a great wonder this is! Filled with hundreds of duties, there is happiness here, for which a person always acts.

Oh, the greatness of contemplation, what can I say of men, who have overcome mountains of endless duties, and attain happiness.

Just as a sovereign always strives for happiness, so does one engaged in begging for alms always strive.

Separately, they attain happiness, considering accomplishment, all go to achieve the same, and I also follow like them.

Just as a blind person follows another blind person without considering the consequences, similarly, the ignorant person, by not reflecting, repeatedly goes to the ocean of compassion (to seek forgiveness due to their actions).

Desiring to know what is worth knowing, beyond the ocean of doubt, I will reach the other shore, taking refuge in the auspicious boat of the Guru's words.

Thus deciding immediately, the son of Jamadagni, of good intent, set out from that great mountain with the desire to see the Guru.

Reaching the Gandhamadana mountain, he quickly saw the Guru, seated in lotus position, shining like the sun, situated there.

He bowed before the footstool, like a stick on the ground, touched the lotus feet with his head and hands.

So, having bowed down in this way, Rama, Dattatreya, with a pleased mind, blessed him, and graciously raised him up.

"My dear, rise, after a long time, today I see you arrived. Tell me your own state, the events, situated without any illness."

Then, rising by the Guru's words, he, delighted by the Guru's instruction, sat with a joyful heart, and said with folded hands.

Revered Guru, ocean of compassion, immersed in your nectar of grace, how would he be affected by fate-created diseases?

Being situated within the circle of the nectar of your grace, how would a scorching, very frightening disease afflict me?

Internally and externally, by your grace, always delighted, yet situated without separation from your lotus feet.

I am not interested in anything else, even a little bit, seated as I am. Therefore, may I have the sight of your lotus feet again today.

Completeness attained in every way, revered Guru, indeed. Yet, there’s something, unsettling in my heart for a long time.

I wish to ask you that, a long-standing doubt within, permitted by you today, I ask the question.

Hearing thus the words of Bhargava, Dattatreya, an ocean of compassion, delighted, then said to Rama with affection.

Ask, Bhargava, what you have to ask today, long accumulated. Pleased by your devotion, I will tell what you desire.

Thus ends the first chapter of the Questions of Bhargava in the Knowledge Section of the Tripura Rahasya in the illustrious Itihasa Uttama.
