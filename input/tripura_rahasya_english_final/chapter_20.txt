Chapter 20
Here, I will narrate to you what happened in ancient times. Listen, long ago, in the assembly of Brahma, in the very pure highest realm.

A discussion of knowledge took place, with subtle and deeper deliberation. Present were Sanaka and others, Vasistha, Pulastya, Pulaha, and Kratu.

Present were Bhrigu, Atri, Angiras, Praceta, Narada, Cyavana, Vamadeva, Visvamitra, and Gautama.

Present were Sukra, Parashara, Vyasa, Kanva, Kashyapa, Daksha, Sumantu, Shankha, Likhita, and Devala.

Thus, other groups of sages and the best among royal sages all gathered there in the grand assembly of Brahma.

The deliberation was performed very intensely, with subtle explanations. The sages there asked Brahma.

O Lord, we knowers of the highest and the lowest in the world see various states of the enlightened ones due to differences in nature.

Some are always absorbed in samadhi, some are engaged in deliberation, others are immersed in devotion, and others still rest on imperishable actions.

But some are engrossed in worldly dealings, like outward-facing men. Among them, who is better? This you should tell us.

We know our own standpoint to be better, O Lord. Thus asked, Brahma said, thinking of their unsettled minds.

O great sages, I do not know this entirely. Therefore, the omniscient Supreme Lord would know this matter.

Let us go there to ask, thus having said, he went there with them, meeting the Lord of Lords, they united with Vishnu.

Brahma, the creator of the world, asked that question of the chief sages. Having heard the question, Shiva, knowing the intention of Brahma's mind.

Thinking of the unsettled minds of the sages, the god thought, "Even if I say something here, it would indeed be useless."

Thinking that the sages, filled with disbelief, would know due to their own standpoint, Maheshwara, the Lord of Lords, replied.

Listen, O sages, I do not even know this clearly. Therefore, let us meditate on the divine knowledge, the Supreme Goddess.

By her grace, we will know even the hidden meaning thereafter. Thus spoken, all the sages, along with Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva.

They meditated on the knowledge of Maheshani, Tripura, embodying consciousness. Thus, all meditated upon Tripura, embodying consciousness.

The Supreme, composed of consciousness and space, composed of sound, appeared. There was a deep sound like that of thunder in the sky.

Let the sages speak, what did you meditate upon and quickly desire? Indeed, for some of my devotees, the desired does not fail.

Having heard the supreme words, the best of sages bowed down. Then, Brahma and others praised with various hymns.

Then the group of sages spoke that knowledge of Tripureshwari. Salutation to you, O great Goddess, O sacred knowledge, O ruler of Tripura.

You are the creator of all, sustainer in oneself, dissolver of all, O Supreme Goddess, salutation to you.

You are ever new because there is no birth for you. You are ever fresh because there is no old age for you.

You are all, the essence of all, omniscient, delighting all. You are not all, not going everywhere, without essence, not omniscient, not delighting all.

O Goddess, again salutation to you in front, behind, below, above, at the sides, in all directions, repeated salutations to you.

Tell what your other form, power, and knowledge are. The result, means, primary practitioner, and perfected one.

Tell the supreme state of perfection and the best among the perfected ones, O Goddess. Again, repeated salutations to you.

Thus asked, the great knowledge began to explain, being compassionate to the group of sages, with clear meaning and supreme words.

Listen, O sages, I will explain everything in sequence. I give you the nectar extracted from the ocean of scriptures.

Where all this world, like a reflection in a mirror, arises, is situated, and dissolves, always shines for all.

Which indeed shines as the world-like form for those unaware of the Self, which shines without distinction for yogis in the Self alone.

Which is like the deep, still ocean, unshaken illumination, which is worshipped by great devotees with great love, free from deceit.

Knowing naturally the sweet place of nature, even with a sense of differentiation, it is worshipped by those extremely devoted.

The thread of life within the senses and inner faculties, in the absence of which there would be nothing, as indicated by the scriptures.

The supreme brilliance of the goddess, the supreme form, spoken by me, beyond and above many universes, in the ocean of nectar.

In the island of jewels, in the kadamba forest, in the gem mansion, on the throne composed of five Brahmas, is the form of Tripurasundari.

The beginningless pair called Aparā, O lords of sages, and Sadashiva and Ishana, Brahma, Vishnu, and three-eyed Shiva.

Ganesha, Skanda, the guardians of directions, the powers, the hosts of deities, demons, gods, serpents, yakshas, kimpurushas, and others.

All my forms called Aparā are said to be worshipped. But deluded by my illusion, they do not know me everywhere.

I alone, being worshipped by all, give the desired result. There is no one else other than me who is worthy of worship or a bestower of fruits.

As one meditates upon me, one obtains my result. My power, O group of sages, is declared as infinite.

Without depending on anything, I, the non-dual consciousness, manifest as the infinite worlds, O best of sages.

Thus, even though manifesting always, I do not leave the form of non-dual consciousness. This is my primary power, the difficult-to-comprehend visualization.

O sages, see my power with subtle vision. I am the support of all, pervading all, and remain alone.

By my own illusion, not knowing myself, I have wandered for a long time. Knowing my own self again, I have attained the state of a disciple of the guru.

Always liberated, I become liberated again and again. I create this world without material cause.

Such as these, there are many series of my powers. It is not possible to count them even with a thousand mouths.

Listen, I will briefly explain my power in part. This varied journey of the world is spread everywhere.

My knowledge is of various kinds, from distinctions like duality and non-duality, and from distinctions of higher and lower. Its results are also varied in many ways.

Knowledge of duality is indeed various, depending on the second. It is said that meditation on it is similar to dream realms.

That is also fruitful, to be known by regulation, because it is fixed. Another is also varied, and the main one is indeed that.

The said meditation of main and secondary, the primary result sequence, is indeed the non-dual knowledge, declared as higher knowledge.

Without worshipping me, the supreme, for a long time, how can the supreme glorious knowledge called non-dual be attained?

That non-dual knowledge is indeed the supreme consciousness alone, whose pure state realization overpowers duality realization.

When the mind attains its own self alone, it indeed becomes illuminated knowledge, O best of sages.

The illumination of the pure self from scripture or reasoning, and the destruction of the appearance of body and such as self, is called knowledge.

That indeed becomes knowledge by which anything, even though shining anywhere, does not appear in any way.

That indeed is non-dual knowledge by which anything would not be unknown at any time, even a little.

The essence of all knowledge, which would be knowledge indeed, that is indeed non-dual knowledge, the supreme, O best of ascetics.

When such knowledge arises, doubts gathered from ignorance dissolve like clouds by the wind. Indeed, that is supreme.

All impressions of desires in which nothing remains are like a toothless snake. That knowledge is remembered as supreme.

The result of knowledge is the dissolution of all sufferings. The attainment of complete fearlessness is called liberation.

Fear arises from the conception of duality. Where would be the conception of duality when non-duality is firmly known, like darkness at sunrise?

Sages do not have fear anywhere in the absence of the conception of duality. Therefore, whatever other result would be, that fear would be in every way.

The second is indeed finite, observed more in the world. In every way, finite fear exists. Therefore, where would be fearlessness?

Union ends in separation in every way. Result union also perishes. Thus, it is certain.

As long as other results are stated, fear is described as much. But that result, in the form of fearlessness, is declared by all.

When the result of the self, non-other, is declared as liberation, and when the knower, knowledge, and object of knowledge also become one.

Then indeed is the supreme liberation, devoid of all fear. Knowledge free from doubts and deliberations, devoid of ignorance.

The clear self-nature of the knower is initially not perceived. Therefore, the teacher and scripture are perceivers, not otherwise.

This indeed is said to be the nature of what is to be known, as long as the difference between the knower, knowledge, and the known appears.

As long as the difference among the knower, knowledge, and the known appears, there is no knower, knowledge, or the known. When the difference is dissolved, they are mutually established.

Then, the attainment of the knower, knowledge, and the known is indeed remembered as this result. Up to the result of the knower, knowledge, and the known, in reality, there is no difference.

For the sake of worldly conduct, the difference is assumed there. Therefore, there is no unprecedented result to be obtained here.

The self indeed appears as knower, knowledge, and known by illusion. As long as it appears, worldly existence would be like a mountain.

When somehow this appears free from difference, worldly existence would dissolve like cut clouds by the wind.

For such great liberation, devotion to that is indeed the means. In complete devotion to that, no other means is desired.

In incomplete devotion to that, what use are thousands of good means? Therefore, devotion to that is indeed the main means of liberation.

In every way, the state of "I accomplish this" with devotion to that. Who is connected with devotion to that is indeed liberated by nature.

Liberation may come in days, months, years, or another birth, depending on the purity of intellect and the duration involved, whether short or long.

In the intellect, indeed, there are many faults destructive of all meanings, by which people are constantly tormented in the terrible cycle of existence.

Among them, the first is lack of faith, the second is desire tendencies, and the third is dullness; thus, the collection of faults is said to be of three types.

Lack of faith is of two kinds: doubt and misconception. The first doubt is whether liberation exists or not.

The first misconception here is that liberation does not exist. These two, doubt and misconception, are the primary obstacles in devotion.

These two, doubt and misconception, would gradually be destroyed by contrary determination. The primary means here is cutting the root, and there is no other.

The root of lack of faith is contrary reasoning. Abandoning that and establishing correct reasoning.

Contrary determination, preceded by root cutting, then by the rise of faith, destroys lack of faith.

Desire and other tendencies in the intellect obstruct hearing. An intellect filled with desire and other tendencies indeed does not function.

In the world, even a desirous person always focused on the desired does not see what is placed before and does not hear what is spoken in hearing.

Thus, for one filled with desire and others, the heard is like the unheard. Therefore, conquer desire and other tendencies by the wealth of dispassion.

There are thousands of tendencies like desire, anger, and others. Among them, desire is fundamental; in its destruction, nothing remains.

Therefore, by the connection with dispassion, destroy the desire tendencies. Hope, indeed, is said to be desire, situated as "this should be mine."

In the possible, it is gross, and in the impossible, it is subtle. By the practice of firm dispassion, one should destroy all of them.

There, the root is the contemplation of the faults of desires every moment. Disinterest in the objects and destroying the tendencies, thus.

The third intellect fault, which is situated in the form of dullness, is incurable by practices in every way, O best of sages.

By which even heard with devotion, the intellect does not rise, that dullness is indeed a great fault, destroyer of purpose.

There, except for service to the self-god, there is no other cause. By the gradation of service, I remove its dullness.

By nature, whether little or great dullness, immediately or in another birth, the attainment of its result would be of one with dull intellect.

All the wealth of practices, by my devotion indeed, attains; and who is always by devotion without deceit, attains to me.

He who quickly removes obstacles to practice becomes successful; the one who honors me, the Lord, who expands all intellects.

Neglecting, if one is only focused on practice due to ignorance, he may be obstructed at every step and may or may not attain the fruit.

Therefore, sages, primary intention should be the practice. Thus, one with intention is remembered as the supreme practitioner.

There, the practitioner endowed with my devotion is respected by all. Accomplishment is self-realization and the thought that the body is not the self.

The thought of selfhood is certainly situated in the body, etc. Its mere negation is accomplishment free from ignorance.

The self is determined by all, but not as the pure self. Therefore, indeed, a great series of misfortunes is attained.

Therefore, pure consciousness which illuminates the body, etc., determining this as the pure self, removes all doubts.

Accomplishment is this, thus said by the wise; not any other accomplishment than this. Accomplishments like the ability to move in the sky, becoming small, and others, indeed.

Self-knowledge accomplishment does not deserve even a sixteenth part of those. All those accomplishments are limited by space and time.

This should be unlimited self-knowledge of auspicious nature. Only those are all well established in the practices of self-knowledge.

These are obstacles in the practice of self-knowledge. What is desired with those like magical accomplishments?

For one whose state of Brahman is directly equivalent to straw, how many of these accomplishments are indeed causes of wasting time?

Therefore, accomplishment should be from self-knowledge, not otherwise. By which the complete destruction of sorrow happens and is full of bliss.

That only is the accomplishment, not otherwise, freeing from the grasp of death. This self-knowledge accomplishment is by different kinds of practices.

Briefly, by the difference in the purity of intellect and the difference in ripening, there are threefold: best, medium, and inferior.

In the world, the activities of the twice-born are reciting the Vedas, by intellect, and by great practice, are involved in hundreds of activities.

Even the Vedic knowledge, recited with unbroken letters, is best, for the concentrated one in activities than of the unconcentrated one.

Even like before, recited with unbroken letters, Vedic knowledge, for the medium one, who is always studied thus only by the practice of investigation.

The Vedic knowledge, recited extremely with unbroken letters, is indeed not grasped, for the inferior. Thus only, the self-knowledge accomplishment is threefold, O sages.

When taking up great activities, one may be engaged without interruption, or at another time, with some interruption, however, is always united.

Depending on that, there may be states of less and more: best, medium, and inferior. Here, only the best is designated as the supreme limit of accomplishment.

When there is a supreme state even in dreams and other states, that accomplishment, equal to a moment of contemplation, is supreme.

When engagement in all activities, with effort through awareness of impressions, is declared as the supreme limit of accomplishment.

When the supreme state in the sensitive self is without effort and uninterrupted, then accomplishment has reached its limit.

When engaged in activities, one sees that state but does not see duality, then that accomplishment has attained completeness.

When one acts in waking, etc., like sleeping, then that state of accomplishment has attained completeness.

Thus, having attained accomplishment, he is called the best among the accomplished. Always engaged in activities, he does not abandon meditation.

Sometimes even the wise are considered the best among the accomplished. He always knows the various states of the wise.

By self-experience alone, he is considered the best among the accomplished. He has no trace of doubt or desire.

Fearless in activities, he is considered the best among the accomplished. He knows all happiness, sorrow, and worldly activities.

Knowing in oneself, he is considered the best among the accomplished. He sees the self as both extremely bound and liberated.

He who sees all souls in oneself is considered the best among the accomplished. He always sees the webs of bondage clearly in oneself.

He who does not expect liberation anywhere is considered the best among the accomplished. I am the best of the accomplished here, and there is no difference between me and him anywhere.

Indeed, sages have clearly said this with reasoning. Knowing this spoken by me, one is not deluded anywhere.

Thus, having said this, the supreme knowledge ceased, O descendant of Bhṛgu. Having heard this, all the sages removed their doubts.

Having bowed to Shiva and the other lords of the world, they went each to their own abode. This Song of Knowledge, destroyer of the multitude of sins, has been spoken to you by me.

Heard and properly considered, this very excellent Song of Knowledge, bestower of self-sovereignty, is directly described as knowledge.

For those who read daily, pleased, she bestows knowledge herself. In the ocean of worldly darkness, she becomes a boat for those who are sinking.

Thus ends the twentieth chapter named "The Conclusion of the Songs of Knowledge" in the revered Tripura Rahasya.
