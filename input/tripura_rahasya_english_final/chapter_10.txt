Chapter 10
Then Hemalekha saw that her beloved, having attained the supreme state, did not move from it for a moment.

Awakened, he opened his eyes and saw the beloved world, desiring again to rest in that state with great speed.

As he closed his eyes, she spoke, taking her beloved's hand, speaking sweetly.

Lord, what was your intention? Tell me what happened to you from closing or opening your eyes. Consider your gain or loss.

Opening the eyes, what is not attained? And what is attained by closing them? Tell me, beloved, I wish to hear your state.

Thus asked by her, he spoke like an intoxicated person, lazy, unwilling to speak, weighed down by laziness.

Beloved, I have indeed attained utmost rest after a long time. There is no rest for me in the external world, full of sorrow.

Enough of external efforts and contemplations. Blinded by misfortune, I did not know the true happiness of the self until now.

As someone wandering for alms does not know his home, similarly, I did not know the ocean of my own happiness again and again.

Thinking the best sensory happiness is filled with a mass of sorrows and as fleeting as lightning, I sought stability due to attachment to it.

Surely afflicted by sorrows, I did not attain rest. Alas, people are devoid of the discrimination between sorrow and happiness.

Seekers of happiness always foolishly gather a collection of sorrows. Enough of that self-acquired sorrowful experience.

Beloved, have mercy on me, I request with folded hands. I wish for long rest in myself, in the blissful self.

Alas, struck by fate, you appear to be, even knowing this state, but still abandoning that, you foolishly strive for sorrow.

Thus spoken, she, slightly smiling, spoke to her beloved, "Lord, that supremely pure state is not known to you."

Where the wise and pure-hearted do not delude, that state is far for you, like the sky to one on the ground.

By you, something may be known, but it is unknown. Closing or opening the eyes, that state is not seen.

Without doing or doing, it is not attained ever. Without going and even going, one does not reach that state.

How can the full state be attained by closing, doing, or going, measured by the opening of an eyelash?

If hidden within, then the state would indeed be always full. Oh, your grandeur of delusion is a wonder, what can I say?

In which crores of universes are positioned at different angles, that is hidden by the opening of an eyelash's width of a finger?

Listen, prince, I will tell you the essence of truth. Until all the knots are broken, one does not attain happiness.

There are crores of knots turned into ropes of delusion. The lack of self-awareness is said to be the rope of delusion.

Where those knots of perverted understanding are, there is the first certainty of inquiry into selfhood in the body.

Under whose control this world spreads out and it is difficult to resist it, so in the world, the understanding of non-self is supported by perception.

Thus, the certainties of separation between the soul and God are considered knots. This has arisen for long and is again reformed.

The person entangled in the form of knots is bound. From that, by the loosening of those knots, liberation from bondage is declared.

Which, closing your eyes, you sufficiently attain your state, that state is your own form, pure and supreme consciousness.

That itself is the great mirror surface of the entire world. When, where, and by what form is it not? Explain that to me.

When one says your consciousness is of any form, then indeed limited to that time and place, it is like the son of a barren woman.

As a reflection doesn’t exist without a mirror, similarly, O lord, renouncing that state, there is nothing anywhere.

By opening your eyes, what would it hide? As long as you understand this, the knot is still firm.

As long as that state is not attained, what is attained is not that. By closing or opening the eyes, what you think is attained is not that state.

Therefore, that which is complete and undivided, due to limitation, by actions, indeed — where is that protector not there, O Lord, like the dazzling radiance of the fire of time?

It makes one's own self known with great imagination, the accumulation of fuel. Knowing the supreme state, there remains no duty for you.

Abandon the knot, controlling, "I see," established in the heart. Uproot the supreme, firm knot, "This is not I."

See everywhere the self filled with unbroken bliss. See in the self the entire world like a reflection in a mirror.

Not contemplating again, approach the remaining within, then seeing the entire self everywhere, be at peace with your own self.

Thus, hearing the words spoken by his beloved, Hemachuda, pure-hearted, knowing his complete self everywhere, he became free from delusion.

Gradually, by attaining complete immersion and steady contemplation, he always remained, roaming with Hemalekha and groups of young women.

Ruling his prosperous kingdom, having conquered enemies in battle, making others hear scriptures, hearing them, and earning wealth.

By performing Ashvamedha, Rajasuya, and other major sacrifices, remaining on earth for twenty thousand years as a liberated soul.

Observing his son established in the state of liberation while living, the king, along with Muktachuda and his brother Manichuda, also thought.

Why does he not appear here as before at all, neither rejoicing extremely in happiness nor disturbed in sorrow?

Why does he see gain and loss, enemy and friend with equanimity, performing royal duties like an actor on the stage?

He always appears intoxicated like a drinker of intoxicating beverage, always elsewhere in mind, sufficiently performing duties as if.

For what reason, and thus approaching him in private somewhere, they asked Hemachuda, "Why are you thus?"

Then, Hemachuda gradually explained his state to them, enlightening both his brother and father.

Having attained the supreme truth, they became liberated while living. Then, hearing this, the group of ministers also understood the world's condition.

Considering the nature of their own self, they became knowers of the knowable. Thus, in the city of Vishala, gradually, indeed, mutually.

From instruction, all knew the truth, from children to cowherds, men, women, young and old, male and female servants also.

Knowing the knowable, having abandoned body-consciousness, they became indeed without desire, anger, or greed.

Be it a child or an elder, without being knowledgeable, somewhere one exhibits, by anger, desire, and others, engaged in worldly affairs.

Mother plays with the child, talking about the supreme truth. Male and female servants always serve their master similarly indeed.

Conversing about the supreme truth with words, actors perform drama with characters related to truth.

Singers sing words focused on the news of discernment. Jesters always criticize worldly affairs.

Scholars indeed teach scriptures to students and people with examples suitable for the consideration of the supreme truth.

Thus, there, men and women, male and female servants, actors, jesters, attendants, soldiers, ministers, artisans, and courtesans.

All of them became knowers of the knowable in the city of Vishala, engaged in worldly affairs by the strength of previous impressions.

Does not remember the past, good or bad, nor contemplates the future, as causes of joy, sorrow, etc.

In the present, smiling, rejoicing, grieving, getting angry, always a person extremely engaged in worldly affairs, like one intoxicated with honey.

Such was that city which sages like Sanaka called the famous city of knowledge upon arriving.

Where even caged parrots continuously say, "Worship your own self in the form of consciousness."

There is nothing known apart from consciousness, like the reflection in a mirror. Consciousness is the known, I am consciousness, and everything, both moving and non-moving, is consciousness.

Because everything shines following consciousness, which is independent, therefore, people worship consciousness that illuminates and supports all.

Worship pure consciousness, abandoning illusion, with clear vision. Even animals, extremely, in such a place, speak these words.

Even today, that place is called the famous city of knowledge. There, formerly, Hemalekha indeed enlightened (them).

Hemachuda became wise and liberated while living, and others, including women, children, and others, all became knowers of the highest and lowest truths.

Therefore, the source of well-being is indeed association with the wise, and in desiring well-being, one should first take refuge in the wise.

Thus ends the tenth chapter named "Conclusion of Hemachuda's Story" in the revered Knowledge Section of Tripura Rahasya.
