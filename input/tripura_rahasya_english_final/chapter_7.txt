Chapter 7
Thus questioned by her dearest husband, Hemalekha, wise and well-acquainted with the state of the world, replied rightly.

Listen, dearest, with a steady mind and respect, I will tell you. The mind, indeed, is always unstable like a monkey.

Because of this, ordinary people have obtained great misfortune. An unstable mind is seen as the cause of all suffering.

Because in deep sleep, due to the absence of movement, one finds happiness. Therefore, stabilizing the mind, listen to what I say to you.

What is heard with disrespect becomes as if not heard. It is absolutely fruitless, like seeking support from a painted tree.

Abandoning unstable reasoning, which is destructive, people relying on sound reasoning quickly obtain good results.

By relying on sound reasoning, one quickly becomes dedicated to one means. Having attained faith generated by sound reasoning, a man bears fruit here.

Abandoning that unstable reasoning, see, dear, this activity of the world which is fruitful with faith.

With sound reasoning over time, a farmer tills the earth. Likewise, with faith, one obtains silver, gold, gems, and medicines.

They decide with sound reasoning, abandoning unstable arguments. Therefore, with sound reasoning and faith, one should decide the welfare of oneself.

One should strive for its attainment, not relying on unstable arguments. One should not desist from effort and striving, like the followers of Shunga.

With faith, one dedicated to effort should not be hindered in any way. Relying on firm effort, how can one not achieve the result?

Through effort, farmers obtain grains, merchants obtain wealth, kings obtain the kingdom's wealth, and scholars obtain knowledge, the foundation of all happiness.

Laborers obtained wages, gods obtained nectar, ascetics obtained the highest world, and others obtained their desired goals through effort indeed.

With unstable reasoning and without faith, what result has a person ever obtained? Tell me, considering that.

Sometimes, due to failure to achieve results and absence of assurance everywhere, one should understand him as afflicted by fate, appearing as one's own enemy.

Therefore, relying on effort nourished by faith and sound reasoning, one should resort to that foremost means of welfare.

There is observed diversity of means, and among them, one should achieve that which is achievable in every way, as that is indeed the principal.

Deciding through sound reasoning and experience, one should quickly begin. I will explain all that to you. Listen attentively.

One should know that welfare from which one does not grieve again. Grief is seen everywhere by subtle vision.

That which is intertwined with griefs is not welfare in any way; wealth, sons, wives, kingdom, treasury, strength, and fame.

Knowledge, intellect, sight, body, beauty, and wealth—all these are unstable, placed in the mouth of the serpent of time.

Situated as the seed of the great power of the sprout of grief, how can it be deserving of suitability for ultimate welfare?

Therefore, the highest welfare primarily lies in this; thus, in the matter of wealth, etc., there is a delusion of desirability.

Arisen from delusion, the great lord is the deluder, who indeed is the creator of all worlds; therefore, all are deluded.

Even a little people are deluded here due to a portion of knowledge; some indeed, not all, because that knowledge is limited.

Even people with little knowledge have surpassed the deluder in deluding; then who is capable of surpassing the great god, the great deluder?

Who in the world knows the little delusion by counter-knowledge, he, having emerged from delusion, remains calm and obtains eternal happiness.

Even such knowledge is not attainable without resorting to the deluder until one pleases him in every way.

Therefore, without pleasing the great deluder, how can one cross the great delusion? Therefore, one should resort to him in every way.

Whoever pleases him properly, having attained his grace, will certainly achieve transcendence from that delusion through great knowledge.

Other practices mentioned for achieving welfare would not yield results without the grace of the great lord.

Therefore, one should first worship the great lord, the cause of the universe, with devotion, and quickly accomplish practices that destroy delusion.

This world is seen directly as an effect, along with its parts, thus beginning with the earth, even with an unseen cause, sufficiently.

By reasoning thus, firmly established by many scriptures, one should ascertain a doer there, distinct from all doers.

Although some scripture here says the world is without a doer, that is well refuted by many scriptures established by reasoning.

Where the purpose is indeed self-destruction, based only on perception, that is merely the appearance of scripture, not a great authority.

Scripture solely constructed from dry logic should indeed be rejected. Others also say that this world is eternal.

If this world is considered as done by one without intelligence, it is also incongruous, as action is preceded by intelligence and that action is not observed in the absence of intelligence.

Supported by many scriptures, indeed, the doer here is intelligent. Action done by an intelligent doer is certainly observed there.

Thus, by sound reasoning and scriptures, this world has a doer, but that doer is distinct from worldly doers.

Due to the inconceivable nature of the effect, the doer has inconceivable and infinite power and unlimited capability, in conformity with the effect.

He is indeed capable of uplifting those who have surrendered in every way. Therefore, always take refuge in him with all your being.

I will state an example to you, listen to the reason with belief. Even a limited lord here in the world is pleased without deceit.

This lord of the world, properly pleased by someone, engages a man with desired objects for his welfare.

Tell me, what would the one who is the only affectionate to devotees not give to him? Indeed, men who are lords in the world are unstable and not affectionate.

Merciless and ungrateful, therefore their result is unstable. The supreme lord is an ocean of compassion, grateful, and well established.

Otherwise, in the beginningless cycle of existence, how could one attain faultlessness? Tell me, how could the world’s course be established?

Because the kingdom of the unstable is seen to be lost, therefore, he is described as an ocean of compassion and well established.

Quickly take refuge in him with all your being and devotion. He will engage you in welfare; do not go to subordination.

Worship is of various kinds, for the distressed and wealth-seeking, but somewhere there is also causeless worship, and that is true worship.

It is seen everywhere that when the lord is worshipped by the distressed, sometimes, overcome with compassion, he releases them from their distress.

Sometimes, he disregards worship due to differences; similarly, for wealth-seekers, the result is limited and uncertain.

Knowing the causelessness of the causeless worshipper after a long time, even the limited lord, being unstable, becomes dependent on that strength.

For knowing the causelessness, it may take a long time due to ignorance. This lord of all, is the lord of the heart of all, indeed.

The lord knows everything and quickly gives the result to the distressed and the wealth-seeker, engaging them with that purpose.

By his own law, waiting for the ripening of actions, the lord orders the result for the causeless worshipper who is his exclusive refuge.

Knowing this, the lord becomes the provider of well-being for all beings, without waiting for the ripening of actions, shaking off his own law.

Having accomplished that means, the lord quickly engages in the result; this indeed is lordship and great independence.

Destined law is also opposed by the lord; this is seen in the son of Mṛkaṇḍu, exceedingly devoted to the lord.

It is known by all that Maheśa can transgress the ordained fate. I will tell you the reasoning behind this; listen, dear to life.

Even though ordained fate is not to be transgressed, for those lacking determination, that fate is not negated.

Therefore, through breath control, fate is conquered. It does not impose sufferings sufficiently on those who are determined, this is seen.

Those who are swallowed by the serpent of fate, lacking determination, indeed experience this as designed by fate.

Fate is the power of the lord, solely of the nature of will. The true will of the lord is indeed not to be transgressed.

She becomes hindered when devoted to the supreme lord, and she also becomes unhindered because she becomes such.

Therefore, abandon faulty reasoning and take refuge in lord Maheśa. He causelessly engages you in welfare.

This is indeed the first step to the mansion of welfare. Leaving this, there is no fruit-bearing elsewhere.

Having heard these words, O Rāma, Hemachūḍa, with a very pleased mind, asked his dear again.

Dear, tell me about Maheśa, who can be my refuge, the creator of all, the independent self, by whose power the world is controlled.

Some call him Vishnu, others call him Shiva, Ganesha, also Surya, Narasimha, Buddha, and Sugata.

They have called him Arhant, Vasudeva, Prana, Soma, Pavaka, and said in many ways that action, the main principle, and atoms are him.

The form of the world's cause is divided by various beliefs. There, where should the understanding of the lord be considered?

It is certain that nothing is unknown to you because of the lord Vyāghrapāda, who has seen the past and future, has said so.

Therefore, you women also shine with this knowledge. Tell me, dear nectar-speaking one, faithfully.

Thus asked, Hemalekha, delighted, said to her dear, "Lord, I  will explain to you. Listen to the decision about the lord."

The lord is indeed the creator and dissolver of the universe. He is Vishnu, Shiva, the creator, Surya, and Soma.

He is indeed all in every way, designated by all. He is not Shiva, not even Vishnu, nor the creator, nor another.

I will explain this to you; listen very focused. They say Shiva, the five-faced and three-eyed, is the creator.

He is the creator, like a conscious potter with a body. In the world also, a conscious creator with a body is seen.

A bodiless or unconscious entity is never observed as the doer anywhere. Therefore, the principal doership is indeed only possible for the conscious.

Because in dreams, this soul, leaving the gross body, creates all desired things with a body of consciousness.

Therefore, the body is an instrument in the actions of the conscious self. Because living beings depend on instruments, their independence is incomplete.

Indeed, the Lord, the creator of the world, due to complete independence, creates everything without depending on anything, without deficiency.

Therefore, the body does not exist; this is the principal conclusion. Otherwise, like the world, the doer would depend on a material cause.

Thus, by the collection of causes like place and time, the Lord creating the world would indeed become a living being.

Complete sovereignty would be destroyed in the creation of the world earlier as well. The doership of all would be obstructed; there is no doubt.

Therefore, indeed, the world is created without depending on a visible body. Therefore, the gross body does not exist in reality, beloved of life.

In the supreme form, indeed, the gross-minded are deluded in this bodiless form. The devoted, meditating wherever and however, are not.

Thus, the wish-fulfilling gem for devotees assumes many forms itself. Therefore, indeed, the Lord is conscious, and his body would be supreme consciousness.

Consciousness is indeed the great existence, the empress, the supreme goddess. Tripura shines in whom, undivided yet appearing as divided.

This moving and non-moving world is like a city of illusion. Due to the oneness of its form, there is no notion of high and low.

Others, indeed, imagine primary and other forms. Therefore, the wise one should worship the supreme form, indeed, without parts.

The one whose intellect is firmly attached to the gross form is incapable. By worshiping that without reason, he indeed attains the ultimate unsurpassed good. Otherwise, his path would not reach anywhere, even in millions of births.

Thus ends the seventh chapter named "Description of the Nature of God" in the Story of Hemachuda in the revered Knowledge Section.
