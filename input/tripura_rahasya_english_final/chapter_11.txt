Chapter 11
Having heard the very wonderful story of Hemachuda, Bhargava, with a doubtful mind, began to ask.

O revered teacher, the knowledge you have spoken is very wonderful, but it appears to me to be difficult and unattainable in every way.

How is this visible world of the nature of pure consciousness? It is unseen, and indeed, this can only be accepted by faith, not otherwise.

Consciousness, being free from objects, is not perceivable in any way. This is not feasible in any way. How can the mind ascend to this?

With kindness, I should be completely enlightened in this matter. Thus asked, Guru Dattatreya said to Bhargava.

Listen, O Rama, I will explain the nature of the visible as it is. This visible world is entirely pure vision and not otherwise.

Here, I will explain the rationale. Listen attentively and focused. This visible world is the effect, perceptible from the cause.

Creation is a new appearance every moment. This world shines with newness, emerging every moment.

Some say this world arises in a single moment, while others say it is an aggregate of elements, composed of moving and unmoving.

It is ascertained that in every way, the world arises. Therefore, the theory of nature is not appropriate due to excessive implications.

By consistency and contradiction, the determination of cause and effect, and the coherence of activities, how can it be accidental?

Sometimes, even if the cause is unseen, an unseen cause should be assumed. Conformity to this is indeed justifiable, as stated by all.

Repeatedly, an effect seen with a cause should be assumed to have a cause even when not seen, otherwise, universal experience would be contradicted.

Activity would be contradicted; therefore, everything has a cause. Thus, for every effect, there is some cause.

Everywhere the world is seen; therefore, there is nothing without cause. Some say the effect is produced by unreal atoms.

For them, it would be extremely different, even absolutely non-existent. Unity of non-existence and existence is indeed contradictory and cannot be.

Indeed, drunk and not drunk, light and darkness, cannot be one due to contradiction and resulting confusion.

Even due to the will of the Lord, how could the origin of the first action arise? The world being of the nature of equilibrium of qualities is impossible.

This world appears due to being a cause of inequality and deficiency in the cause of equality, by intelligence without basis, and due to lack of evidence.

Therefore, the cause of the world's activity is not perceived. The unseen has the basis in scripture, not other consideration.

Due to the imperfection of the perceivers and the instability of the means of knowledge, the separation of the effect and the doer is repeatedly observed.

This world, having a doer, indeed, he is conscious. How can the doer of an unimaginable form be common?

Therefore, he is of unimaginable power, the scripture is his reflection. The means of knowledge of the complete is indeed uninterrupted and superior in all respects.

There, indeed, one Lord Shiva is described in the past as independent, without a material cause, due to the grandeur of independence.

On his own foundation, the world picture is revealed for play, as imagined alone in the kingdom of dreams.

With the sense of 'I', one grasps the body, likewise the world. Your form is not as the body, due to the distinction in dreams.

Likewise, his world body does not dissolve in distinction. Indeed, you are separate from the body, etc., as pure consciousness.

Thus, the deity with the single form of the void and consciousness, immutable, by him, this world picture is revealed in oneself.

Where could one reveal the world picture, except in one's own, where is it possible for another to reveal it? What can exist at any time except consciousness?

Where one says the absence of consciousness, that place indeed does not exist. The absence of consciousness is not proven by anything, therefore, consciousness is supreme.

The great existence, devouring the world, complete, appears like waves without the ocean, or light without the sun.

As the world does not exist without consciousness, therefore, this great god has the form of pure consciousness.

Before creation, from him was born, there it is sustained, in him it dissolves in the end, this world of moving and non-moving.

Thus, the well-known meaning in scripture is not contradicted. In unseen matters, agreement is the evidence in scripture.

Because the powers of jewels, mantras, etc., are seen everywhere, one of limited understanding does not comprehend the great result of jewels, mantras.

Therefore, the scripture spoken by the omniscient, all-seeing, mentions the god indeed situated in the beginning of creation.

Without a material cause, indeed, in the beginning, he created the entire world because the great god is endowed with complete, pure independence.

On the foundation of consciousness, the entire world picture is revealed. That world does not exist anywhere outside.

Due to the completeness of the lord, there is no other place here. That which is situated in another place is not proven by any means.

Likewise, just as a reflection on the mirror surface, the world is revealed in the deity, thus everything is consistent.

At the beginning of the world, indeed, the actions of the god resemble a yogi's, and creation is considered as resembling a city of imagination by the god.

O Rama, your mental creation is only mind-made, full of many measures and measurables, indeed, it appears.

Although differentiated into many forms, there is nothing other than the mind; whatever arises from the mind remains there and merges there.

That, being purely mental, as likewise the world from Shiva; Shiva is of the form of pure consciousness, consciousness without form.

Embodied with the unity of infinite powers of Tripura, witnessing all, that consciousness is entirely complete, devoid of division.

Time and space in this world are remembered as causing division; there, space is formed of shapes, but time is formed of actions.

Tell me, how would form or action, based on that consciousness, cause divisibility?

Tell me, in which place and time does consciousness not exist here? Where there is no consciousness, how would that be indeed?

Indeed, the existence of objects is not another illumination. Illumination is said to be consciousness, not of non-consciousness.

But illumination would be supreme, which independently illuminates. The insentient are not self-illuminating, indeed, they are by the illumination of consciousness.

Indeed, consciousness illuminates in itself without depending on others. The insentient illuminate relying on consciousness, and not otherwise.

Listen, if even in non-illumination, objects exist, then in this world, the condition of existing and not existing would not make sense.

Therefore, the existence of objects in the world is the illumination of consciousness, and not another, just as the existence of reflections is in the mirror only, indeed.

Thus, consciousness is the existence of the world, therefore, everything becomes consciousness, and what shines more is purity, not impurity.

Based on the degree of hardness and purity of reflecting surface, the reflection appears, as either clear or unclear.

In the mirror and water also, this is observed clearly; due to the insentience of the mirror, they lack independence.

Reflection's dependence is due to consciousness' pure independence and non-dependence; purity is inherently established in consciousness, from the absence of impurity.

Impurity would be of diverse qualities, but consciousness is not diverse; from the nature of unity, the power of consciousness, and from indivisibility in all ways.

From the nature of non-empty self, purity in self is superior in all ways; the appearance of non-self, is illumination by its connection to others.

Those who know the nature of reflections declare the reflection; that the world is like this, it is observed by all.

By itself, it does not shine anywhere, but shines by the support of consciousness. Therefore, the world is like a well-measured reflection in a mirror.

Consciousness, even when colored by varied other states, illuminates without deviating even slightly from its nature, like a mirror.

As the reflections in the mirror are not different from the mirror, so are the reflections in consciousness not different from consciousness.

The reflection in the mirror is indeed established as the cause of the image; consciousness may be the cause of its independence, just as the reflection is indeed of the world.

O Rama, see all the states reflected in oneself by self-will, appearing without cause, without any original image.

Will is indeed declared as the independence of consciousness; in the state without will, that consciousness is of pure single form.

Thus, from the pure single form of consciousness, before creation, there was great independence, indeed of the nature of will.

From that, this reflection-like world manifests; from the stability of great will, this shines for long.

The common world shines from the cause of full independence; for others, due to their incompleteness, it shines with an uncommon nature.

By repeated practice, with jewels, mantras, etc., as much as one leaves constraints in oneself, thus indeed, there is illumination.

See, O Rama, the magician, illuminating the world-picture without using materials, indeed, everywhere by will.

The common, stable world, suitable for one's purposes, again indeed, one withdraws this into oneself; thus, the world shines.

See, the yogis perceive that creation as enveloped in full stability; but other than yogis consider the external creation with their own limitation.

Having only a mental body, enter the mountain with me. Thus addressed, the king, unable to leave the body, said.

O sage, how shall I leave this body? Explain. If I leave it by force, I will completely come to destruction.

Thus speaking, the sage's son smiled and said to the king, Oh, you are ignorant  of yoga. Let it be, close your eyes.

Having spoken thus, with closed eyes, he entered the king in a moment, pulling his subtle body and throwing the physical body into a pit.

The mirror is indeed immovable there, but the reflection is moving; similarly, the world is moving, while consciousness is immovable and all-encompassing.

Therefore, the states have the nature of one considering them; like, the sunlight indeed is the illuminator of objects.

For owls and others are blind during the day, it is opposite, like darkness; illumination and darkness are not clearly distinct for them.

Thus, poison may be poison for some and non-poison for others. For humans and others, nature is observed with fear and is harmful.

For yogis and celestial beings, the nature is non-harmful. Time and place, which seem long to humans and others, are influenced differently too.

It is indeed the opposite for gods and yogis, just as the distance appearing in the mirror seems different from the actual distance.

Similarly, its nature is not stable in consideration. Therefore, nothing exists without support.

What exists and shines is indeed only consciousness, the great goddess. Thus, the world is rightly said to be of the nature of one consciousness.

Thus ends the eleventh chapter named "Explanation of the Essence of the World" in the revered Knowledge Section of Tripura Rahasya.
