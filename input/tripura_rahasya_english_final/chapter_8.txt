Chapter 8
Thus, having heard the beloved's words and understood the essence of the great lord, Hemachooda determined that Tripura is made of consciousness by Hemalekha's words.

With a calmed mind, having known Tripura, the great goddess endowed with supreme powers, from the teachers, he realized her supreme qualities.

Following her single-mindedly, Hemachooda became firmly devoted, and thus, by worshiping her, some months passed.

Tripura, the supreme goddess, bestowed grace in his heart. His mind turned away from objects and became deeply contemplative.

This much is rare in the world without the grace of others: a mind inclined to contemplation, which is the principal cause of liberation.

O Rama, until a deeply contemplative mind is born, the ultimate good is not attained by hundreds of means anywhere.

Then, again, on some day, he was together in private with his beloved, with a deeply contemplative mind.

Seeing him coming to her place from a distance, she rose, brought him in, and seated him on her seat.

By washing his feet with respect and worshiping him according to the rule, she spoke supreme words, beautiful with the flow of nectar.

Beloved, today I see you after a long time. Indeed, is your body free from disease, was it disease-prone?

Tell me the events, since I was not remembered by you. Indeed, without seeing me or speaking to me.

Not even a part of the day passed like this earlier. How did this happen? I think you are displeased with me, not on the right path.

In a dream or elsewhere also, how did this happen? Tell me, how did you spend a night, even one, which felt like an age before?

Without me, even one moment felt like an age, very hard to bear. Saying this, she embraced him and appeared distressed for a moment, then.

He also, embraced by his beloved, did not show even slight discomfort. He said, dear, you should not confuse me like this.

I have known you firmly; there is no cause of sorrow for you. You, knower of the ultimate, wise, how could delusion touch you?

I have come to truly ask you something; listen to what I will say. Tell me clearly about the events you mentioned before.

Who is that mother of yours mentioned, or your friend, and who is her husband? Who are her children, and also, are they mine or yours? Where are they?

That is not well known to me, nor do I think it is falsely spoken. But it is spoken by you completely by implying something.

Analyze that and explain it so that I will clearly know. I am devoted to you, remove my doubt in the heart.

Thus addressed, Hemalekha, with clear eyes and a pure mind, thought about the divine grace endowed.

Indeed, he is very detached from sense objects due to great fortitude, struck by the power of Lord Mahesha, fruitful due to the accumulation of merit.

It is time for awakening, and therefore I will enlighten him. O lord, your great fortune is indeed obtained due to the grace of the Lord.

Otherwise, one does not see disinterest in sense objects anywhere. This characteristic is known from the beginning as the grace of the Lord.

Behold, I will explain to you the conduct stated by the wise, the mind's disinterest in enjoyment and inclination towards contemplation.

The supreme consciousness is my mother, intellect is considered my friend, and ignorance is indeed called unreal, by which the intellect is well-associated.

The power of ignorance is clearly seen in the world, as it makes a rope appear like a snake and causes great fear.

The great delusion is its son, the mind is its son, its wife is imagination, and their five sons are the sensory organs.

The five sensory organs are their place, and perception of objects is the impression of the mind.

That enjoyment is dream enjoyment, the sister of imagination. His other wife is great consumer desire, and her two sons are anger and greed.

Anger and greed are said to be their city, which is the body. My great mantra is indeed the self-revelation.

Breath is called Pracara and is the dear friend of the mind. Forests and others are described as hells. Thus, everything is described.

The union of intellect with me is called concentration. The attainment of my mother's world is stated as liberation, dear.

Thus, I have described my own story. Yours is also similar, indeed. Understanding this well with reasoning, attain the supreme welfare.

Thus ends the eighth chapter named "Explanation of the Description of the World" in the revered Knowledge Section in the story of Hemachuda.
