Chapter 2
Thus instructed, the son of Jamadagni, having bowed to the sage, son of Atri, with humility, bent and began to ask.

O Lord, revered Guru, noble one, all-knowing, ocean of compassion! In the past, anger arose in me due to the lineage of my ancestors.

In addition, deeply embedded within, lies the warrior's lineage, concealed like an embryo in the womb. Indeed, twenty-one times has my heart been filled with the burden of warriors.

The groups of ancestors, satisfied and pleased by the respect of my devotion, calmed my anger. Even though I was initially commanded by the ancestors.

Now, in Ayodhya, dwells Shri Rama, Hari himself. Blinded by anger, I was again overcome by power and pride against him and was led astray.

By him, expelled from pride and defeated by the Lord, I somehow escaped alive by the compassion of the Supreme Brahman.

Then, profound dejection overwhelmed me. Then, I wandered extensively on the path, I lamented many times.

I suddenly met Samvarta, the leader of ascetics, on the path. Covered with ashes, like hidden fire, somehow I recognized him then.

Like heated mist, he was cool all over. Upon meeting him, indeed, I attained a very cool state then.

By me, asked about his state, he spoke sweetly as nectar. He drew out everything, like extracting essence from a stalk, and imparted it all to me.

I was not capable to touch that, like a beggar touching a queen. Entreating again, he then directed me to you.

Then, your pair of feet was reached by me, like a blind man finding company of people, extremely blissful.

That which the sage Samvarta said is not known to me. I heard the complete greatness, which creates devotion to Tripura.

She, the goddess in your form, is always established in my heart. Thus, what result is attained by my existence?

O Lord, kindly tell what Samvarta previously said. Without knowing that, there is no fulfillment anywhere.

Without knowing what was said, whatever is done by me appears futile, like a child's play.

Previously, indeed, many times by sacrifices with profuse gifts and abundant food, the gods led by Indra were worshipped by me.

That fruit indeed is small result, it is heard from the mouth of Samvarta, I consider that small, which is indeed sorrow in every way.

Without happiness, indeed, sorrow would be greater. Little sorrow is considered happiness, because in the absence of happiness, sorrow would be heavier indeed.

Not only this much, indeed, more than this is the glory, the embrace of death, there never will be anything worse than that.

Thus, indeed, whatever is done by me in the worship of Tripura appears to me like child's play, because everything is in the mind.

This, what is said by you to do, should be done accordingly, otherwise, it would be different. Depending on the difference of words, the duty might be different

Different supports and diverse practices are perceived accordingly. How is this comparable to a ritual that yields true fruit?

Since it is based on an untrue self, how can it become like the truth? Nevertheless, one must always perform their duties; there is no limit for them at any time.

Observed by me, the divine Samvarta, entirely cool, free from the poison fire of the trace of duty.

Smiling, as if in the world system, he has taken refuge in the fearless path, in the forest mixed with a forest fire, he was like an elephant residing in cold water.

Delighted by the taste of the nectar of the lack of all duties, how did he attain this state, which he had said to me.

With kindness, O Guru, you should speak all this to me. Liberate me, swallowed by the serpent of duty and time.

Thus, having said, holding the feet with his head, he bowed like a stick. Then, seeing Bhargava in that state, worthy of liberation.

With a compassionate nature, then, Dattatreya began to speak. "My dear Bhargava, you are blessed whose intellect is such."

Like the arrival of a boat to one drowning in the ocean, this, indeed, is the association attained by virtuous actions.

Ascends oneself to the supreme pure state. She, the goddess Tripura, of the form of space in all hearts.

Without any other refuge, the devotee, devoted towards this form, is quickly transformed within the heart, and would be liberated from the net of death.

As long as a man does not firmly fear the ghosts of duties, till then he does not attain happiness, always like one possessed.

Of men bitten by the serpent of duty and time, how is there auspiciousness? Like bodies scorched by the terrible poison flames.

See, indeed, the world, unconscious by the association of the poison of duty, blinded, does not know the action beneficial to itself.

Otherwise, acts again, falls into delusion again. Indeed, this world is such, unconscious by the poison of duty.

From time immemorial, cooked in the terrible ocean of poison, just as some travelers reached the great Vindhya mountain.

Overwhelmed by the burden of hunger, they saw fruits in the forest, quickly desiring fruits, they ate the poisonous berries of Tinduka.

They ate, extremely destroyed by hunger, their senses lost taste, then they were greatly distressed, their bodies burned by the poison flames.

Blinded and searching to calm that poison heat, from consuming the Tinduka fruit, not knowing that it is a poisonous fruit

Thinking of the flame in their own body, they took the Datura fruit, in delusion, mistaking it for lemon, and it was well eaten by all.

And then they became insane and fallen from the path, falling into the dense blindness, into the low grounds.

Cut all over the body by thorns, with broken arms, thighs, and feet, they insulted each other and quarreled loudly.

With fists, stones, and sticks, they struck each other, then, torn all over the body, they reached some city.

At midnight, by fate, they approached the city gate, and were blocked by the guards at the entrance.

Without knowledge of place and time, they quarreled loudly. Then, when they were excessively struck by the gatekeepers.

Then, intent on fleeing, they became scattered around. Some fell into the ditch and some were devoured by crocodiles and others.

Some fell into pits and wells and gave up their lives. Others were killed by them, and some were taken into captivity.

Thus, people with desires of welfare, unconscious by the poison of duty, alas, go to great destruction, indeed, greatly blinded by delusion.

You are blessed, Bhargava, because you have reached prosperity. Contemplation is indeed the root of all and the first step.

In attaining the highest good, the great mansion, know in every way that without good contemplation, whose attainment of welfare would be possible?

Lack of contemplation is supreme death; people destroyed by lack of contemplation. One who contemplates conquers everywhere by desirable associations.

Without contemplation, demons and ogres are destroyed in every way. The gods, full of contemplation, enjoy happiness in every way.

Relying on Vishnu through contemplation, they always conquer enemies. Contemplation is the seed and sprout energy of the tree of happiness.

A man shines by contemplation, greater in every way. By contemplation, the order is excellent. By contemplation, Vishnu is worshipped.

Indeed, by contemplation, Shiva, the great Lord, was all-knowing. Without contemplation, Rama, the best among the wise, was attached to the deer.

In great distress, then, by contemplation, building a bridge over the ocean, Rama attacked the city of Lanka filled with demons.

Without contemplation, even Brahma became foolish due to pride and attained beheading. Thus, it is indeed heard by you.

The great god, Shiva, without contemplation, giving a boon to the demon, indeed afraid of turning to ashes himself, resorted to fleeing.

Without contemplation, Vishnu previously killed Bhrigu's wife. By the curse, he attained great sorrow and suffered extremely unbearable distress.

Thus, others, gods, deities, demons, men, and animals, due to lack of contemplation, indeed attain distress.

O Bhargava, greatly fortunate are those wise ones, who are never abandoned by contemplation, salutations to them continually.

Attaining duty without contemplation, they become deluded everywhere. By contemplating and doing, one is freed from all boundless distress.

Thus, for a long time, this lack of contemplation became associated with people. As long as there is lack of contemplation, where would be reflection?

In the summer, in the desert heated by intense rays, where is cool water? Thus, one is surrounded by the long-lasting fire of lack of contemplation and flames of impurities.

How would the cool touch of contemplation be without the means? But the means here is one, indeed, the means is supreme and greater in every way.

The supreme grace of the deity residing in the lotus of all hearts, without that, how would there be easy attainment of great welfare for anyone?

The sun of contemplation is the dispeller of the great darkness of lack of contemplation. There, the root would be worship of the deity with devotion.

The supreme goddess, when completely worshipped and pleased, then attains the form of contemplation, like the sun in the sky of the mind.

Therefore, worship Tripura, the supreme goddess, dwelling within all, the great goddess of consciousness, auspicious.

Worship without deceit through the true guru gradually. In worship, the root would be devotion and pure faith.

There also, the root is praised as hearing its greatness. Therefore, to you first, Rama, the greatness has been told.

By hearing that, now you have attained auspiciousness. Contemplation is the root of prosperity because you are not afraid.

Until the rise of contemplation, there is great fear. Daily affected by the defect of lack of contemplation.

As indeed, affected by disorder, by taking medicine, similarly until the impurity of the element is removed, there would be fear.

Attaining supreme contemplation, life becomes fruitful for men. In all births of men, until there is supreme contemplation.

So many trees of birth are barren due to the cause of fruitlessness. Even that tree of birth is indeed fruitful where there is contemplation.

Men are like well-frogs without contemplation, as a frog born in a well does not know anything.

Good or bad, in the well it perishes. Likewise, people are born in vain in the well of the universe.

Good or bad, they do not know of themselves anywhere. Arising again and again, they perish, not knowing their own benefit.

Understanding happiness in sorrow and sorrow in happiness, due to the greatness of lack of contemplation, so they are cooked in the fire of transmigration.

Afflicted by sorrow and not abandoning it in any way, just as a great donkey, even when struck by a hundred foot blows.

People indeed follow the cycle of transmigration like donkeys. But you, O Rama, with contemplation, have reached beyond sorrow.

Thus ends the second chapter on the Greatness of Contemplation in the Knowledge Section of the revered Tripura Rahasya.
