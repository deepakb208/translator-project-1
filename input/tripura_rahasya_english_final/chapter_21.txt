Chapter 21
Having heard thus, Rama, the descendant of Bhṛgu, who was deluded by the net of ignorance, became nearly liberated after listening to the sage Dattatreya.

Again, he asked Atri's son, having bowed with devotion, "O Lord, tell me the well-ascertained means to knowledge."

Tell me the essential, easy, and directly fruit-giving means, and the characteristics of the wise by which I will quickly know them.

How do the wise maintain their state in union and separation from the body, and how do they conduct themselves with an unattached mind?

With great kindness, please clearly tell me all this. Thus, Atri's son was asked by Jamadagni's son.

Pleased, the ocean of compassion addressed Bhārgava (Rama) and said, "Listen, Rama, I will tell you the secret means to knowledge."

The principal means to knowledge is the supreme grace of the deity, which is approached with all emotions as one's own deity.

It is certain that for him, knowledge becomes very easy. This is stated as the highest means to knowledge, Rama.

This is capable of achieving results independently of others. Without this, nothing else here can properly give fruit.

Listen here to the reason, Rama. This is with reason. Knowledge, which is pure consciousness, illuminates everything.

The imagined covering of its illuminating nature, but by inquiry and removal, leads to the realization of its true nature.

And that is very difficult for others who are focused on external things, but for devotees who abandon otherness and focus on devotion, it becomes easy.

Indeed, it is well ascertained that for one devoted to the deity, it becomes easy and quickly attainable, requiring little other means.

Knowing oneself somehow, one should describe it to others. Describing it always, Rama, one attains absorption.

Thus, through description and firm absorption, attaining the state of Shiva, the mind becomes free from joy and sorrow.

Wherever he goes, all that is consecrated to Shiva. The highest knower, established in the state of liberation, does this.

Therefore, with great devotion, explain this again to others. This is the best means; there is no other equal to this.

With devotion, there is no other means equal to explanation. The characteristics of the wise, Rama, are indeed difficult to understand.

Because it is all inner and not perceptible to the eye, speech, etc., it is not possible to describe or write it anywhere by others.

As the knowledge of scriptures is not known by others in the world through body, clothes, ornaments, etc., similarly, it is not known by others.

Wisdom is known only by self-awareness and not otherwise, just as the knowledge of flavor is known by tasting it, O Bhārgava.

Still, by the wise and learned, it is known by their speech, just as the path is known by tiny ants.

There are gross characteristics that are many-sided, but the subtle characteristics are difficult to comprehend by others.

The description, speech, and demonstration of practice, like the wise, are seen to be possible by others as well.

The means to knowledge, practiced by those with impure hearts, becomes firm for them. This is stated as their characteristic.

Know him as the highest among the wise, for whom honor and dishonor, gain and loss, victory and defeat are not slightly distinguishable.

The highest among the wise is he who, when asked about self-experiences, replies instantly and without doubt, even with hidden meanings.

The characteristic of the wise is the one who has extreme enthusiasm in discussions of knowledge and does not avoid explaining it.

He is the highest among the wise who, by nature, does not initiate actions, is content, has a pure mind, and remains peaceful even in great calamities.

Such characteristics, O best of Bhārgava, are stable in the self-examination of the wise, without a doubt.

The seeker should always be dedicated to self-examination, just as he skillfully engages in examining others.

Thus, examining oneself, how can one not attain success? When dedicated to non-examination of others' virtues and faults.

When one is dedicated to examining one's own virtues and faults, then by attaining all means, one attains success.

Thus, O son of Bhṛgu, the stated characteristics of the wise are always useful in self-examination.

But in the examination of others, these are many-sided. Because the wise who are extremely pure-hearted, O best of Bhṛgu.

Their success is established by seemingly perfect means. Therefore, they follow past tendencies and engage in activities.

How can they, with ordinary conduct, be examined? But the wise do their examination by the power of practice.

Like jewel examiners by superficial observation, those with body consciousness are like fools to the dull-witted.

Because they do not attain natural meditation, as long as they are engaged in inquiry, they remain full in form.

When turned away from inquiry, then due to body consciousness, experiencing pleasure and pain, they remain extremely like animals.

Even though they attain satisfaction intermittently by reaching a state of completeness, their animal-like state lies between true reflections.

Like a burnt rope does not bind, when the edges of the cloth are dyed with lac, it appears decorated.

By spreading, even the middle of the cloth becomes entirely dyed red. Thus, his activity is centered in the midst of consciousness.

Having attained unity with the form of consciousness, she does not become bound. The association with the body does not exist for the middle-wise at all.

Identification with the body is said to be association with the body by the wise. That does not exist for the middle-wise ever, O Rāma.

By excessive practice, his mind is always absorbed. His activity is not there, as his mind is always composed.

Even the maintenance of his body is like deep sleep. Just as someone in deep sleep sometimes acts only by tendencies.

Saying or doing something, he does not know anything afterwards, just as a drunk person does not know what he speaks or does.

Thus, this great yogi, beyond worldly activities, sometimes does something but does not know it again.

But the body always functions by past tendencies. For the highest wise one, even the body does not exist.

He performs activities like a charioteer, situated as if with a chariot, doing actions but not being the body of the chariot.

Just so, the charioteer would be engaged in body activities, not the body nor the actor, but of pure consciousness.

With an inner pure mind, he acts externally as one dressed as a woman in a play, assuming a dual role.

As an adult playing with a child is free from being a child, thus, this one engaged in the play of the world is pure-hearted.

The middle-wise, by excellence of restraint, achieve a steady state. The steady state is by the excellence of inquiry.

By the ripening of wisdom, there is a difference between the middle and the highest. Here, listen to the conversation between the wise, I will tell you.

Formerly, there was a king named Ratnāṅgada, the lord of the mountain. He resided near the Vipāśā river, in a city named Amṛtā.

He had two great sons, wise and steadfast, Rukmāṅgada and Hemāṅgada, very dear to their father.

Rukmāṅgada was deeply knowledgeable of the scriptures, and Hemāṅgada became highly wise, the highest among the wise.

Both of them, surrounded by all their armies, went out for hunting in the spring, entering the dense forest.

Having killed many deer, tigers, hares, and buffaloes, and extremely exhausted, they reached and stayed by the lake.

On the other side of the lake, under the banyan tree, the Brahma Rakshasa, a knower of all scriptures, abundantly debates with scholars.

For a long time, he remains eating the defeated ones, Rukmangada, curious about the debate, heard from the speech.

Having gone there with his brother, he engaged in debate, was defeated in the debates, and captured by the Brahma Rakshasa.

Rukmangada captured, seeing that, Hemangada said to him, "O Brahma Rakshasa, you do not deserve to eat him."

Defeating me, his younger brother, then eat us together. Hearing Hemangada's words, the Brahma Rakshasa said.

Food I’ve obtained after a long time, hunger troubles me. With this meal done, I will debate with you.

Then, defeating you also, by eating, I will be extremely satisfied. Thus is my decision, O king.

This boon obtained for a long time from the great soul Vasishta, once his disciple came and was eaten.

Named Devarata, I was then cursed by the great soul, from hereafter, eating a human, O Brahma Rakshasa.

Your face will be burnt, thus the sage said. Afterwards, requested again by me, granted to me an excellent boon.

In debates, defeated mortals you eat entirely, thus, I eat those defeated in debate.

After a long time, this food is obtained by me, abundant everyway. Having eaten, then in debate, I will defeat you, O king.

Thus said, ready to eat, again Hemangada said, "O Brahma Rakshasa, hear my well-requested words."

Even after something obtaining, how can you release him, speak that to me. Giving you that, I will release my brother.

Thus spoken, he said again to the king, the Brahma Rakshasa, "Listen, O king, there is indeed something by which I release him."

Who would leave food dear to life as the time approaches? But there is one condition of mine, some questions situated in my heart.

If you answer my questions, I will release  your brother. Then Hemangada said, "Ask them, I will answer you."

Thus spoken, the Brahma Rakshasa asked the prince, hidden questions in order. "I will speak that, listen, O Bhargava."

What might be spread from the sky, more subtle than the smallest, what form does it take, where is it situated? Tell this, O prince.

Consciousness is spread from the sky, subtler than the smallest particle, sparkling in form, residing within the self. Listen, O Brahma Rakshasa.

How can one, even very spread, be subtler? What is the sparkling nature and what is the self? Tell this, O prince.

Due to causation, it is spread, subtle due to intangibility, and also the self is sparkling consciousness. Listen, O Brahma Rakshasa.

What is the place of realization, and how is it obtained? By realization, what may it be? Tell this, O prince.

The intellect's place in realization is obtained by concentration. By realization, birth may not be. Listen, O Brahma Rakshasa.

What is this intellect of yours called, and what kind of concentration is that? What may be birth also? Tell this, O prince.

Consciousness covered by inertia, the intellect may be, concentration rests in the self. Birth is body-consciousness intellect. Listen, O Brahma Rakshasa.

Why is there no realization of consciousness, and by what is it obtained? How is birth obtained? Tell this, O prince.

From lack of discernment, realization is not obtained by the self. Birth is from the ego of doership. Listen, O Brahma Rakshasa.

What is lack of discernment, as you say? What is the self? What is the ego of doership? Tell this, O prince.

Lack of discernment is distinct knowledge, ask self in the self. That tendency of self-importance ego may be. Listen, O Brahma Rakshasa.

By what is lack of discernment destroyed, and what is its cause? What is the cause of that also? Tell this, O prince.

By contemplation, it is destroyed indeed. Dispassion is its cause. The cause of that is fault-seeing. Listen, O Brahma Rakshasa.

What may be contemplation, and what is called dispassion? What is said to be fault-seeing? Tell this, O prince.

By examination of the seer and the seen, its abandonment in the seen, understanding of pain in the seen, is indeed. Listen, O Brahma Rakshasa.

By what may all this be, and from what is it obtained? There, what may be the cause? Tell this, O prince.

By the grace of the deity, all is accomplished by devotion. The cause is indeed good company. Listen, O Brahma Rakshasa.

What is the deity called, and what is said to be devotion? What kind of good people are said to be? Tell this, O prince.

The deity is the world sustainer, and devotion is said to be dedication to that. Good people are peaceful and compassionate. Listen, O Brahma Rakshasa.

Who always fears in the world, who is always focused on sorrow, and who is always full of dejection? Tell this, O prince.

The very wealthy one is always fearful, and the one with a large family is sorrowful. One engulfed by desires is always miserable. Listen, O Brahma Rakshasa.

Who may be fearless in the world, and who may be without sorrow? Who may always be without dejection? Tell this, O prince.

The fearless one is free from attachment, without sorrow is one with a conquered mind, (without misery is) knower of the known, the self of oneself. Listen, O Brahma Rakshasa.

Who may be hard to perceive in the world, and who is seen without a body? What is the action of the inactive? Tell this, O prince.

The liberated while living is indeed hard to perceive, he is without a body, even having a body. His actions are those of the inactive. Listen, O Brahma Rakshasa.

What exists and what does not exist in the world? Who may be absolutely impossible? Having said thus, O king, I’ll release the elder brother quickly.

The seer exists, indeed the seen does not exist. The transactions of the world are indeed impossible. This is said. O Brahma Rakshasa, release my brother quickly.

Having heard this, the Brahma Rakshasa, satisfied, released Rukmangada. Then afterwards, he indeed became a Brahmin.

Seeing the radiant embodiment of penance in the form of a Brahmin, the princes asked with doubt, "Who are you?"

Then the foremost Brahmin told his own story as it was. "I was formerly a Brahmin, well-known in Magadha."

"Famous as Vasuman, expert in all scriptures, I defeated many in assemblies, again and again, proud of my knowledge."

"Scholars by the hundreds, Brahmins, then I became extremely proud. Once, in the assembly of the king of Magadha, a sage named Ashtaka..."

"Knower of the higher and lower, completely tranquil, for debate, I met him. Skilled solely in dry logic, inquiring into self-knowledge."

"Then I challenged him only with logical arguments. His words of resolution were well-supported by many scriptures."

"Criticizing with webs of logic, I became focused on insults. Even insulted many times by me, in the assembly of the king."

"He was calm and silent. Then his disciple, the great soul Kashyapa, cursed me out of anger, in the assembly of the king."

"Teacher, you insult my teacher inappropriately, lowest of the twice-born. Since therefore, for a long time, you will become a Brahma Rakshasa."

"Cursed thus by him, greatly frightened, I, trembling, bowing, quickly took refuge in the sage Ashtaka."

"To me, then he showed compassion, even to the opponent, the calm-minded. He gave an end to the curse for me. Listen attentively to that."

"The questions made by you to me, and answered by me indeed, those established solely by logic, when that one will answer."

"Some wise one will liberate you from the curse then. Today you are freed from that curse after a long time, O prince."

"That, you I consider a great soul, knower of the known, best among men." Thus spoken by him, the Brahmin, the prince became astonished.

Then again the prince, questioned entirely by him, enlightening Vasuman completely, went to his own city.

Bowing to Vasuman, accompanied by brothers and soldiers, this all is told to you, what was asked by you, O Bhargava.

Thus ends the twenty-first chapter named "The Story of the Demon" in the esteemed Tripura Rahasya.
