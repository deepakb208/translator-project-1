Chapter 6
Hearing these sweet words, Hemachuda, very surprised, laughed and asked her, dear and wise.

Dear, what you have spoken seems strange to me and are unsupported words; today I understand this completely.

Surely, you are born of a nymph, raised by a sage in the forest, who has not yet fully reached adulthood, still in budding youth.

You speak words resembling a possessed being's speech, claiming to have lived for many thousand years. 

Without context, how can I understand this truly? Tell me, where is your friend and where is the friend's son bound?

How old or where are those established? Be it so, what about that event? Tell me where is that friend.

I consider that I have not obtained any such friend of my mother’s, a noble lady in seclusion, nor my own, or my father's, no other dear to me.

Where is my friend or her son? Tell me quickly. I think your words are like a barren woman's son in the world.

Your words are like some actor said something in jesting speech or a barren woman's son mounted on an illusory great chariot.

Or, with oyster shells made to look like golden ornaments adorning the body, or fighting with weapons made from human horns in the sky forest.

Having killed the future king and won the celestial city, or indeed plays with dream maidens in the stream of illusion.

Thus, I think your words are entirely unrelated. Hearing this, she cleverly said to him again.

Lord, how can what I have spoken to you be meaningless? Words of people like me are never unsupported anywhere.

Falsehood indeed is the destroyer of ascetics; where is she among those of truthful character? Why would there be beauty like a corpse in the family of ascetics?

Who engages the inquisitive for other purposes falsely, for him there is neither upward nor downward world as means of happiness.

Listen, prince, to my words: sometimes in the world, a blind person does not attain even vision quickly even with words of medical eyewash.

The foolish mind knows only falsehood and not beneficially spoken words. Dear, why would I engage you, the inquisitive, by falsehoods?

Even if I have spoken falsehood, consider that with a sound mind. Indeed, in the world, a skilled mortal is skilled in all conduct, indeed.

Examining partially, one understands all conditions. I will give you an example, observe here.

Which object was formerly the means to the desired goal? For so long, it was my words, then how is it not a means of happiness today?

He indeed accomplishes happiness in others now, how? You should know your belief by this example.

Listen, O king, to what I say with straightforward and pure intellect. A distrustful enemy in the world becomes firm in trustworthy sayings.

Faith, like a loving mother, always protects the surrendered one from great fears in every way; indeed, there is no doubt.

Prosperity, happiness, and fame leave the foolish and faithless in the trustworthy. He who is without faith becomes entirely devoid of these.

Faith is indeed the nourisher of the worlds, faith is the life of all. Say, in this matter, how can a faithless child live with the mother?

How can a faithless young man flourish with happiness in his wife? Similarly, how can an old man go on the virtuous path, without faith in his children?

Why would a faithless farmer plow the earth? There would be no activity anywhere, neither in renunciation nor in acquisition without faith.

Due to the lack of faith, the existence of the worlds would perish. If worldly activity comes from complete acceptance, listen.

Even in complete acceptance, why is faith established? There also, the sole refuge is indeed the refuge in faith.

Therefore, without faith, the world would surely perish, just like without breathing. Therefore, obtaining firm faith, go to the ultimate happiness.

If you think faith is not to be placed in the lower, listen. Any activity indeed exists by faith, O prince.

Hearing the beloved's words, Hemachuda said again to the skilled speaker, his beloved, "How would your activity be thus?"

Indeed, dear, faith should be placed in every way, when it is to be placed in faith. Faith should be placed in the good, by which welfare is attained.

Faith should not be placed in the bad by one desirous of welfare. Otherwise, it is like a sharp, crooked hook inside.

Just as fish meet destruction by well-ground bait outside, therefore faith should indeed be placed in the good, not in the untruth anywhere.

Those who placed faith in the bad attained destruction, and others also. Examples are those united with welfare, due to faith in the good.

Therefore, believing is indeed proper for faith, not otherwise. Thus, “How would your activity be thus?” was your question.

Thus spoken, Hemalekha said again to her dear husband, "Listen, O prince, to these words being said by me."

You said this question asking how. There, I say to you, "How is your certainty about this being or non-being?"

If there is certainty in the truth, it should become good with faith here indeed. That would also be by characteristics if faith is associated with characteristics.

If knowledge of characteristics is from evidence, then listen to this: What evidence is there for one who lacks faith? Let that be well examined.

Otherwise, the knower would not be contradicted anywhere. Therefore, the whole world operates by relying on faith.

I will explain that method; listen with a steady mind. About unsettled reasoning or no reasoning at all, in every way.

The world would not attain welfare here or hereafter. Sometimes, without reasoning, welfare may come by chance.

For unsettled reasoning, welfare would not come in any way. Once upon a time, on the Sahya mountain by the Godavari river, there was a sage named Kaushika.

He lived with a calm mind, knowing the true nature of the world. Hundreds of his disciples stayed by the guru’s guidance.

One day, they approached the guru to determine the state of the world, according to their intellect, and then they spoke to each other.

There came a highly learned brahmin named Shunga. He refuted the stated opinions of all by his skill in reasoning.

Then, without faith and having lost wisdom, but skillful in debate, he said among the brahmins, "Truth is what is measured from evidence."

Relying only on unsettled reasoning, Shunga refuted all in the debate there.

"O Brahmins, listen to my words. Truth is nowhere established. What is measured by evidence is said to be the truth."

There, indeed, by that defect, it would be immeasurable. First, the defectlessness of the evidence should be ascertained.

Thus, even that created by other evidence should be considered. Thus, from uncertainty, nothing would be measured.

Therefore, the knower, the measured, and the evidence do not establish. Therefore, based on emptiness, indeed, this various alternative exists.

Even he attained a state of emptiness due to lack of evidence. Therefore, nothing, emptiness is real; thus, this is the conclusion.

Thus, hearing Shunga's words, some lowly brahmins among them followed him, becoming proponents of emptiness with apparent certainty.

Those devoted to that went to destruction, attaining the state of emptiness. Those brahmins with strong hearts rejected Shunga's words.

Analyzing by Kaushika, they became composed at heart. Therefore, completely abandoning that unsettled reasoning.

Reasoning always dependent on true scriptures would attain welfare. Thus was Hemachuda told by his extremely wise beloved.

Again, extremely astonished, he asked her, "Oh dear, I did not know before of your such wisdom."

Blessed are you, and blessed am I who has approached you. You say that with faith one attains all auspiciousness. How is that?

Where should faith be placed and where is it not recommended? Due to the multitude of scriptures and their contradictory meanings.

Due to differences in the opinions of teachers and commentators, and the instability of one's own intellect, what should be accepted or not?

What is dear to one, he declares as certain, and another's view is undecided, causing harm, dear one.

No one reaches the end here in deciding which is true or not. He who says truth is emptiness criticizes non-emptiness of another.

From where can one know that though unbelievable is consistent with scriptures? Tell this correctly, dear. Indeed, this is not unconsidered by you.

Thus ends the sixth chapter named "Praise of Faith" in the Story of Hemachuda in the Knowledge Section of the revered Tripura Rahasya in the esteemed Itihasa Uttama.
