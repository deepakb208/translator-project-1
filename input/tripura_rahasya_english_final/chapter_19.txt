Chapter 19
Thus, having heard from the mouth of Dattatreya, the son of Bhrigu again asked about the conduct and works of the liberated, gradually.

O Lord, please explain to me in detail how the varied ripeness of knowledge arises due to differences in intellect.

Knowledge is indeed of one kind, consisting of the awareness of one's self alone. Isn't that the goal that which consists of its manifestation known as liberation?

How, then, can there be dependence on differences in ripeness by the difference in intellect? Do practices differ or not? Explain that.

Thus asked again by him, Dattatreya, the ocean of compassion, began to explain that matter in detail.

Listen, O Rama, I will explain this supreme secret. There is no difference in practice, and knowledge is not achieved through various practices.

The attainment of fruit varies by the gradation of practices. When the practice is complete, knowledge is effortlessly attained.

By the incompleteness of gradation, effort may be required. Essentially, no practice is utilized in knowledge.

Knowledge is not achievable anywhere, as it is accomplished by nature. Consciousness itself is knowledge, always self-luminous.

What need is there for practice for the eternally luminous nature? Consciousness is placed in the very pure casket of the mind.

Submerged in the mire of infinite impressions, it is not perceived. By the waters of restraint, the mire of impressions is properly cleansed.

By the sharp instrument of inquiry and with effort, in the casket of the mind, after a long time, assembled, O Rama, by proper reasoning, it is then opened.

Shining like a jewel, consciousness is perceived. Therefore, O Rama, practice is remembered in the removal of impressions alone.

Due to the presence of few or many impressions, the intellect becomes varied. As much as the flow of impressions covers the intellect, it remains.

The need for practice is as much as for the impressions covering one’s intellect, O son of Bhrigu. Varied impressions are said to be there; I will tell you the chief ones.

By the distinction of fault, action, and desire, that is threefold. Lack of faith is indeed the chief fault, destroying one's self.

Wrong perception is also indeed a fault of man. Mostly skilled in the arts also, not indeed free, due to fault.

By association with the good and scriptures, one does not know the supreme truth. The supreme truth which is without distinction does not exist, nor indeed comes into being.

It is not known by anyone, anywhere. Even having known the supreme truth, this truth does not become supreme.

From this knowledge, how can liberation arise, and so on, this debate exists in many ways? It is either wrong perception or indeed could be doubt.

Indeed, the fault of man, starting with impressions, is proclaimed here. Hundreds and thousands are skilled in scriptural knowledge.

O Rama, obstructed by this, they have attained the cycle of existence, previously driven by the force of bad impressions that remain in the intellect.

The impurity of teaching is an obstruction to acceptance. By which, even if correctly taught by teachers, it is not accepted, indeed.

The impression of actions is said to be difficult to overcome by restraint. Desire, with residual duty, may be endless with many branches.

Indeed, someone may count the waves in the ocean of Rama, the particles of earth, or the stars.

But indeed, even the desires of one person cannot be counted. This, O Rama, is the third fault, impression of desire said to you.

More expansive than the sky, more immovable than the mountain, this demon of hope, O Rama, which is the impression of desire.

Indeed, by this, all this world is situated like a madman. Burning by which, this world always cries out.

Some in the world, the most fortunate, by the refuge of the great mantra, are liberated. They shine, their limbs cool in all respects.

By these three impressions in the mind (fault, action, desire), O Rama, since the mind is overwhelmed, therefore, indeed, that truth does not shine.

Therefore, the destruction of impressions is the result of all practices. The first is indeed removed by the certainty of fault.

The second is removed by one birth, even by many births, by the grace of the Lord, not otherwise, even by millions of efforts.

The third is removed by proper practices like detachment. Detachment indeed arises by seeing the fault, not otherwise, ever.

Indeed, among these, by the distinction of small and great impressions, the expectation of small and great state arises, O Bhargava.

There, the first, the root of all, is the desire for liberation, not otherwise. Without the desire for liberation, hearing, reflection, etc., are not effective.

Not connected with the main fruit, it becomes only like a craft. The supreme state is not attained by mere knowledge of the craft.

Without the desire for liberation, by whom it is heard and properly reflected upon, all becomes in vain, like the decoration of a corpse.

In all respects, weak desire for liberation becomes in vain, O Rama, like the ordinary desire from hearing of fruit, does not bring fruit.

The desire arising after hearing of fruit does not bring the fruit of action. By hearing of fruit, who indeed, doesn’t have the desire for fruit, among living beings.

Therefore, from this superficial desire for liberation, there is indeed no fruit. As the desire for liberation may be intense, thus its fruit is quick.

The desire for liberation, which is most important, is sufficient among the practices. It indeed produces engagement and is said to be dedication.

As one whose entire body is severely burnt does not need coolness or anything else (seeing that it is vain), so when one desires liberation, they do not need anything else indeed in every way.

That desire for liberation becomes intense and capable of achieving the goal. This arises by seeing faults otherwise.

From the face of intense detachment, it gradually attains intensity. Indeed, detachment arises by seeing faults, which destroys attachment to objects.

By detachment, the desire for liberation becomes intense. Dedication arises, and with that dedication, engagement in practices is of extreme intensity.

By the nature of extreme intensity, one quickly attains the fruit. Hearing thus the words of Dattatreya, Bhargava again.

He asked, with a doubtful mind, a very great doubt, "O Lord, you have said that association with the good is the main cause.

The grace of the Lord, and also seeing faults, thus, what is the primary main cause, and how may one attain that?

Indeed, there is nothing without a cause, that is the certainty. So how may this happen without a cause? Tell me this in detail.

Thus asked, Dattatreya, the ocean of compassion, said to Rama, "O Bhargava, listen, I will tell you the supreme source of the supreme good."

The supreme consciousness, which is the goddess, by the power of her own freedom, reflects the picture of the world in herself, like a reflection in a mirror.

She, indeed, assuming the body called Hiranyagarbha, the supreme one, for the desire of welfare of beings covered by beginningless ignorance.

Illuminating the ocean of scriptures, fulfilling all desires, there, beings, by their nature, have various desires and tendencies.

Contemplating how there may be good for them, he created actions for desires with various fruits in every way.

A person does good or bad by nature. So, by some, that is due to attachment to the result of actions, indeed.

Wandering in various births, attaining human birth, under the influence of desires, one becomes inclined to actions for desires.

Especially, when one becomes devoted to the Lord due to desires, then, by association, one looks into the divine scriptures.

By hearing the fruits of actions for desires, engaged in actions for desires, obstructed due to not attaining the fruits, due to imperfection of subtle actions.

By curiosity about duty, one indeed approaches some noble person, and by association with him, sometimes hears about greatness.

Of the great Lord, then, by the maturation of previous merits, his engagement in pleasing the Lord may also be, O Bhargava.

Therefore, by the maturation of previous merits, attaining association with the good, one attains the series of steps leading to the supreme good, which is extremely rare.

Mostly, the attainment of the supreme good is stated to be rooted in association with the good, and sometimes by excellent merits or by excellent austerities.

One attains the supreme good suddenly, like the fall of a fruit from the sky. Therefore, due to the variety of causes, there is a variety in the attainment of the supreme good.

Similarly, by the difference in intelligence, by the gradation of tendencies, and by the gradation of practices, the state of the wise is varied.

By nature, whose intelligence has sparse tendencies, for him, indeed, with little practice, the attainment of knowledge happens enough.

Whose intelligence is pure by nature and has no tendencies at all, for him, with little cause, great knowledge happens.

Whose mind is extremely full of tendencies by nature, for him, even though knowledge arises, it appears to be covered.

By that, indeed, achieved again, after a long time, attains completeness. Therefore, the state of the wise is seen to be varied.

By the difference in the maturity of the mind, O descendant of Bhrigu, the difference in state is seen. Therefore, due to the gradation of covering by tendencies in intelligence.

Knowledge is observed to be different, indeed, similarly, the difference in state is. O Rama, see the difference in state among the wise.

Indeed, those who know their nature, such as Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesha, see their difference in state by the qualities born of their nature.

In any way, it is not possible to say  that their knowledge has impurity. The greatness of qualities born of nature is indeed different still.

Just as the body of the wise, being fair, does not become dark, similarly, the nature of the mind also does not assume another state.

O Rama, similarly, see us, the wise sons of Atri, such as Durvasa, Chandra, and me, having attained different states.

See Vasistha, engaged in duties, and such renunciates as Sanaka, who are angry, desirous, and renounce all marks of identity.

See Narada, absorbed in devotion, praising, and Bhrigu, residing with the demon party, the preceptor resorting to the gods.

See Vyasa, eloquent and dedicated to scripture creation, and also king Janaka, and Bharata, the renunciant.

See the different states of the wise by nature, and also others. I will tell you the secret, listen, O son of Bhargava.

The threefold tendencies which are said previously, the second among them is born of actions, in the form of delusion, that is greater among all.

Whose mind has no trace of that, indeed they are intelligent, free from fault, their tendencies of desire and others are gone.

By practice, those who have knowledge without obstacles, for them, dispassion and others are not required.

For them, again, neither contemplation nor meditation is required. By mere hearing once, contemplation and meditation occur.

At that time, having slightly attained, they become liberated while living, knowing the supreme state without doubt, like Janaka and others.

By contrary practice, indeed, they have not destroyed the tendencies of desire and others completely, which are subtle, by pure-minded ones.

Therefore, by them, even in that liberated state known, the previously existing tendencies of desire and others continue as before, continuously.

But, there is not even a little taint on their intellect by them (tendencies). Indeed, they are called liberated and highly regarded by the wise.

O Rama, indeed, the mind which is very deluded by tendencies of actions, for this mind knowledge does not come anywhere, even if spoken by Shiva.

Connected with strong offenses, to them knowledge does not come in any way, whose tendencies are in the form of offenses and actions.

O descendant of Bhrigu, his small tendencies, even if desire-oriented, become abundant by abundant hearing, and similarly by contemplation and meditations.

Knowledge arises over a long time with great difficulty; but his practice is small there by due to the intensity of practice.

If the mind becomes almost destroyed due to the absence of tendencies, indeed, such knowledgeable ones are called middle, whose mind is destroyed.

Indeed, for some of them, due to lack of intensity in practice, the mind, with sparse tendencies, does not become destroyed.

But they are called those possessing dull knowledge, still having a mind, indeed, only those possessing only knowledge are liberated while living, as well as others.

Indeed, those possessing only knowledge, experiencing visible suffering, become bound by prarabdha karma, they are called having liberation at the end of the body.

Those whose mind is destroyed are said to have transcended prarabdha karma. In the field of the mind, the seed of prarabdha karma becomes the sprout of experience.

Due to the absence of the field of the mind, that prarabdha karma, over time, perishes like a rootless seed without potency.

Just as an exceedingly intelligent person can simultaneously perform ten or five actions somewhere without faltering.

Moreover, such people are seen endowed with skill in action, performing multiple activities simultaneously like walking, speaking, and doing.

In this case, with one mind, how can there be threefold action? And how does the teacher observe the many students simultaneously?

O Rama, who was your enemy, Arjuna, the lord of the Haihayas, who improperly followed the distinction of letters and was established in their differentiation, was slain.

With a thousand arms, he fought simultaneously with many weapons separately, without faltering anywhere, indeed seen by you, the wise one.

Their mind, becoming multifaceted, following the respective sequence, accomplishes many kinds of actions, likewise indeed, surely.

Similarly, the highest knowers' self-perception, even when externally directed, always remains undisturbed; they are said to have many minds.

That prarabdha karma, sprouted separately in the field of the mind, becomes burnt by the fire of knowledge each time, again and again.

The sprout of the prarabdha seed has a union of pleasure and pain; reflection on that is said to be the fruit. Wherefrom does the fruit come from a burnt sprout?

Their interaction becomes through gathered insights and recollections, just as a mature person is seen playing with a child.

Like an elephant is pleased or distressed in the destruction of stone by the elephant, thus they rejoice and grieve in actions, those with many minds.

As there is no internal joy or agitation for the one engaged in particular action, thus their conduct is equal and stable everywhere.

For the intelligent and knowledgeable ones, due to the absence of the practice of opposing tendencies, the destruction of tendencies occurs.

Due to the absence of destruction of previous tendencies, the continuation becomes thus; some are devoted to actions, others are desirous and angry.

The highest and knowledgeable ones shine, devoted to various practices. There, indeed, the one with a steady mind is described as a slow-witted person.

By him also, all knowledge is determined as false. In self-realization, nothing at all shines in samadhis.

Samadhi is indeed the reflection of the true nature; nothing else is said to be so. The state of non-duality, as the foundation of all, always.

It certainly shines in all, and in non-shining, there is nothing at all. Likewise, it shines free from thoughts in the stated states.

By that much, samadhi is not achieved by all, indeed, O Bhargava. But, only those who are connected with that reflection are remembered.

Even the consciousness engrossed in worldly dealings is devoid of knowables, known as the sky's blueness is seen again.

Known as false, the consciousness is not connected with that; otherwise, there would be no difference between truth and untruth.

Likewise, grasping the unreal, there is no connection in knowledge somewhere; thus indeed, it is certainly stated for the wise.

Consciousness becomes devoid of knowables due to the shining of the negated, especially of the mindless, because that is the state of unmani.

Where the mind is still, that is said to be the state of unmani; the movement of the mind would be the connection with the true knowable.

These states are simultaneously established in the highest wise ones; he is always both active and in samadhi, O Bhargava.

Therefore, even his consciousness is established devoid of the knowable; thus, this has been said as asked by you before.

Thus ends the nineteenth chapter named "Discussion on the Distinction of States of Knowledge" in the revered Tripura Rahasya.
