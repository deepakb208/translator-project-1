CHAPTER 1: QUESTIONS OF BHARGAVA

Om, salutations to the one who is the cause of bliss, the supreme consciousness, who shines in the universe like a mirror.

O Narada, have you heard with an attentive mind, the greatness of the one named Tripura, which the scripture declares as the supreme means?

Today I will tell you great and wonderful knowledge, which upon hearing, a human being will never experience grief again.

Considering thoroughly the Vedic, Vaishnava, Shaiva, Shakta, and Pashupata knowledge, this conclusion has been reached.

Nothing else like this knowledge should occupy the mind. This was established to Bhargava by the Guru ?ridatta.

Even with reasons and realizations richly adorned, as stated here, one cannot discern if the mind is truly bewildered.

He is unquestionably struck by fate, like an immovable post. Even if knowledge is directly defined by Shiva, he remains unaware.

Listen, I will explain it to you as it stands in the form of knowledge. Indeed, the conduct of the virtuous is wonderfully remarkable and full of superior qualities.

Even this divine sage desires to hear something from me, though he is indifferent. This benevolence is naturally born among the good.

Just as the natural attraction of the deer towards the scent of musk is inherent, similarly, upon hearing from Dattatreya's mouth the grandeur of his greatness�

Rama, the delight of all people and the son of Jamadagni, with good intent and his heart captivated by devotion, became somewhat silent.

Then, having expressed his state of mind, his eyes filled with joy, his body thrilled and full, and his inner self immersed in bliss.

Joy arising, as if emerging by piercing his hair follicles, he bowed to Guru Dattatreya like a stick near his feet.

Rising, filled with joy, he spoke with a choked, sweet voice, "I am blessed, I am accomplished, O revered Guru, by your grace."

When my Guru, who is directly Shiva and an ocean of compassion, is pleased, even the position of Brahma seems insignificant like grass.

Even death attains self-realization from the pleased Guru. Indeed, without any reason, my Guru Maheshvara is pleased today.

I believe I have attained everything through the Guru's grace. O master, by your grace, I have now heard of its entire greatness.

I wish to worship Tripura, the supreme goddess. O Guru, kindly tell me the method of that worship.

Thus requested, Guru Dattatreya, seeing Bhargava's fitness, enhanced by true faith and devotion, for the worship of Tripura.

Gradually, he initiated him into the worship of Tripura. The son of Jamadagni, having received this auspicious initiation of Tripura.

Surpassing all initiations, with the complete awakening of the truth, accompanied by mantra and yantra practices, is the entire process.

Having received nectar from the lotus-like face of the revered Guru, Bhargava, like a bee, became satisfied in his inner self and filled with bliss.

With permission from the revered Guru and prepared for the worship of Tripura, he circumambulated the Guru, bowed, and then proceeded to Mahendra mountain.

There, creating an auspicious and very blissful residence, he became devoted to worship for twelve years.

Devoted to daily and occasional duties, always dedicated to worship and chanting, exclusively devoted to the meditation of Tripureshanya.

Thus, his twelve years passed like a moment. Then, once comfortably seated, the son of Jamadagni thought.

Previously, even when earnestly requested by me on the path, I did not know any part of what Samvarta had said.

Previously, having forgotten, I asked the Guru about the greatness of Tripura Shakti, which I then heard from the revered Guru�s mouth.

However, I did not understand anything Samvarta had said earlier. I had asked the Guru about the topic of creation.

Then, while narrating the story of the battle, the Guru did not share with me the remaining parts, keeping it in context.

I have no knowledge of the slightest bit about the movement of this world. Why has this vast spectacle of the universe arisen?

Where does it go again? Where does it attain a stable position? But I see everything unstable everywhere.

Why is even generally stable conduct affected in this way? I observe strange worldly behavior without reflection.

As the blind lead the blind, resulting in similar actions, so is the behavior of the world observed to be uniform for all.

Indeed, my actions here would serve as an example in every way. Surely, I do not remember what happened in my childhood.

In my boyhood, my behavior was one way; in youth, it was different. Now, indeed, my actions vary in every aspect.

I do not know at all what has become of their actions, in any way, at whatever time, and by whomever they are done.

Having understood it rightly, with prior consideration of the consequences, what outcome has been attained there? By whom has happiness been achieved for the self?

Whatever action in this world is examined as having consequences like fruit, that examination indeed is the fruit. I do not consider that examination as the fruit, when that action is done again by the same person.

When the result is attained, how does one desire another result again? Tell me, for all people always act with a desire for the result.

Indeed, the alleviation of suffering or the attainment of happiness is the result mentioned. Within the distinction of duties, there is neither the complete cessation of suffering nor solely happiness.

Duty itself is described as the greatest sorrow among sorrows. But in its practice, how can one achieve the absence of either sorrow or gain happiness?

Applying a bandage to the entire body of someone who is burned all over is akin to finding happiness through the fulfillment of one's duties.

Just as the embrace of groups of apsaras brings happiness to a person whose heart is pierced by arrows, similar is the happiness gained from the performance of one�s duty.

Just as the hearing of a song for a person afflicted by the disease of consumption of poison, similar is the happiness gained from the performance of one�s duty.

Happy indeed are those in the worlds who are without duty, dwelling under trees, the great souls, whose all bodies are very cool.

If anyone could find happiness in fulfilling their duties, it would be as absurd as a man with a spear wound finding joy in fragrant garlands.

Oh, what a great wonder this is! Amidst countless duties, there is happiness here, for which a person always strives.

Oh, the greatness of contemplation�what can I say of men, who have overcome mountains of endless duties and attained happiness.

Just as a sovereign always strives for happiness, so too does one engaged in begging for alms constantly strive for contentment.

Individually, they seek happiness through accomplishment; all strive for the same goal, and I follow their path as well.

Just as a blind person follows another blind person without considering the consequences, similarly, the ignorant person, by not reflecting, repeatedly goes to the ocean of compassion (to seek forgiveness due to their actions).

Desiring to grasp what is truly worth knowing, beyond the sea of doubt, I seek to reach the other shore by taking refuge in the auspicious boat of the Guru's teachings.

With a firm resolve and good intentions, the son of Jamadagni promptly set out from the great mountain, driven by a strong desire to see the Guru.

Arriving at Gandhamadana mountain, he swiftly saw the Guru, seated in a lotus position, radiating like the sun, and firmly established there.

He bowed low before the feet, like a stick laid on the ground, and reverently touched the lotus feet with his head and hands.

Thus, having bowed down in this manner, Rama found Dattatreya with a pleased mind. Dattatreya blessed him and graciously raised him up.

"Rise, my dear. After a long time, I see you have arrived today. Tell me about your current state and the events, free from any illness."

Then, rising by the Guru's words, he, delighted by the Guru's instruction, sat with a joyful heart, and spoke with folded hands.

Revered Guru, ocean of compassion, immersed in your nectar of grace, how could he be affected by diseases wrought by fate?

How could a scorching, terrifying disease afflict me, being situated within the circle of the nectar of your grace?

Internally and externally, always delighted by your grace, yet ever connected to your lotus feet.

I am not interested in anything else, not even slightly, as I sit here. Therefore, may I behold your lotus feet again today.

In every way, I have attained completeness, revered Guru. Yet, something has been unsettling in my heart for a long time.

I wish to ask you about a long-standing doubt within me. Permitted by you today, I will pose this question.

Hearing the words of Bhargava, Dattatreya, an ocean of compassion, became delighted and affectionately addressed Rama.

 �Ask, Bhargava, whatever has long weighed on your mind today. Pleased by your devotion, I will reveal what you seek.�

Thus ends the first chapter of the �Questions of Bhargava� in the Knowledge Section of the Tripura Rahasya.

CHAPTER 2: GREATNESS OF CONTEMPLATION
   
   Following the sage's instructions, the son of Jamadagni bowed humbly to the son of Atri, and with reverence, began to ask his questions.
   
   O Lord, revered Guru, noble and all-knowing, ocean of compassion! In the past, anger arose within me due to my ancestral lineage.
   
   Furthermore, deep within lies the warrior's lineage, hidden like an embryo in the womb. Indeed, my heart has borne the burden of warriors twenty-one times.
   
   The groups of ancestors, satisfied and pleased by my respectful devotion, calmed my anger, despite the initial command given by them.
   
   Now, in Ayodhya, resides Shri Rama, Hari himself. Blinded by anger, I was once again overcome by power and pride against him, leading me astray.
   
   By him, stripped of pride and defeated by the Lord, I somehow escaped alive through the compassion of the Supreme Brahman.
   
   Then, profound dejection overwhelmed me. I wandered extensively on the path and lamented many times.
   
   I suddenly encountered Samvarta, the leader of ascetics, on the path. Covered with ashes, like hidden fire, I recognized him somehow then.
   
   Like heated mist, he exuded coolness all over. Meeting him, I indeed found myself in a state of profound coolness.
   
   When I inquired about his state, he spoke with the sweetness of nectar. He extracted and imparted all the essence, just like drawing the sap from a stalk.
   
   I couldn't touch it, like a beggar reaching for a queen. Pleading once more, he then directed me to you.
   
   Then, reaching your feet was like a blind man finding companionship � extremely blissful.
   
   That which the sage Samvarta said is not known to me. I have heard the complete greatness that fosters devotion to Tripura.
   
   The goddess, in your form, is always established in my heart. Thus, what is the result of my existence?
   
   O Lord, please share what Samvarta previously said. Without that knowledge, I find no fulfillment anywhere.
   
   Without knowing what was said, everything I do feels futile, like a child's play.
   
   Previously, many times, through sacrifices with generous gifts and abundant food, I worshipped the gods led by Indra.
   
   That fruit, indeed, is a small result. As heard from the mouth of Samvarta, I consider that small, which is indeed sorrow in every way.
   
   Without happiness, indeed, sorrow would be greater. A little sorrow is considered happiness because, in the absence of happiness, sorrow would indeed be heavier.
   
   Not only this, indeed, but more than this is the glory; the final embrace of death. There never will be anything worse than that.
   
   Indeed, whatever I do in the worship of Tripura seems to me like child�s play, as everything resides in the mind.
   
   What you instruct to be done should be followed accordingly; otherwise, the outcome will differ. Depending on the variation in words, the duty may also change.
   
   Various supports and diverse practices are perceived in their own ways. How can this be compared to a ritual that truly yields fruit?
   
   Since it is based on an untrue self, how can it become like the truth? Nevertheless, one must always perform their duties; there is no limit for them at any time.
   
   Observed by me, the divine Samvarta, entirely cool, free from the poison fire of the trace of duty.
   
   Smiling, as if he had taken refuge in the fearless path of the world system, he was like an elephant residing in cold water amidst a forest mixed with fire.
   
   Delighted by the taste of the nectar of being free from all duties, how did he attain this state, which he had described to me?
   
   O Guru, with kindness, you should tell me all of this. Liberate me, as I am swallowed by the serpent of duty and time.
   
   Thus, having spoken, he bowed like a stick, holding the feet with his head. Then, seeing Bhargava in that state, worthy of liberation.
   
   With a compassionate nature, Dattatreya then began to speak. "My dear Bhargava, you are blessed, whose intellect is such."
   
   Just like a boat�s arrival to one drowning in the ocean, this association is indeed attained by virtuous actions.
   
   One ascends to the supreme pure state. She, the goddess Tripura, is of the form of space in all hearts.
   
   Without any other refuge, the devotee, devoted to this form, is quickly transformed within the heart and liberated from the net of death.
   
   As long as a man does not firmly fear the ghosts of duties, he does not attain happiness and remains like one possessed.
   
   What auspiciousness can there be for men bitten by the serpent of duty and time? They are like bodies scorched by the terrible poison flames.
   
   Indeed, observe the world, unconscious due to the poison of duty, blinded, not knowing what actions are truly beneficial for them.
   
   Otherwise, one acts again, falls into delusion once more. Indeed, this world is such, unconscious due to the poison of duty.
   
   Since time immemorial, cooked in the terrible ocean of poison, just as some travelers reached the great Vindhya mountain.
   
   Overwhelmed by hunger, they saw fruits in the forest and, desiring them quickly, ate the poisonous berries of Tinduka.
   
   Overwhelmed by extreme hunger, they ate, losing their senses and taste. Greatly distressed, their bodies were burned by the poison flames.
   
   Blinded and seeking to calm the heat from the Tinduka fruit, which they had consumed, not knowing it was poisonous.
   
   Thinking of the flames in their own bodies, they took the Datura fruit in their delusion, mistaking it for a lemon, and it was eagerly consumed by all.
   
   Then, they became insane and strayed from the path, falling into deep blindness and sinking into low grounds.
   
   Cut all over the body by thorns, with broken arms, thighs, and feet, they insulted each other and quarreled loudly.
   
   With fists, stones, and sticks, they struck each other. Torn all over the body, they finally reached a city.
   
   At midnight, by fate, they approached the city gate, only to be blocked by the guards at the entrance.
   
   Without knowledge of place and time, they quarreled loudly. Then, excessively struck by the gatekeepers.
   
   Intent on fleeing, they scattered. Some fell into ditches, while others were devoured by crocodiles and other creatures.
   
   Some fell into pits and wells, giving up their lives. Others were killed by the guards, and some were taken into captivity.
   
   Thus, people with desires for welfare, unconscious from the poison of duty, alas, go to great destruction, greatly blinded by delusion.
   
   You are blessed, Bhargava, for you have achieved prosperity. Contemplation is indeed the root of all and the first step.
   
   To achieve the highest good, the great mansion, understand that without proper contemplation, attaining welfare in every way would be impossible.
   
   Lack of contemplation is the ultimate death; people perish due to lack of contemplation. One who contemplates triumphs everywhere through favorable associations.
   
   Without contemplation, demons and ogres are utterly destroyed. Conversely, gods, brimming with contemplation, enjoy happiness in all aspects.
   
   By relying on Vishnu through contemplation, they consistently overcome their enemies. Contemplation serves as the seed and nurturing energy of the tree of happiness.
   
   A man excels through contemplation, becoming greater in every way. Through contemplation, order is maintained excellently. Through contemplation, Vishnu is worshipped.
   
   Indeed, through contemplation, Shiva, the great Lord, became all-knowing. Without contemplation, even Rama, the best among the wise, was captivated by the deer.
   
   In great distress, Rama, through contemplation, constructed a bridge over the ocean and launched an attack on the city of Lanka, which was filled with demons.
   
   Without contemplation, even Brahma became foolish due to pride and faced beheading. Thus, you have indeed heard.
   
   Without contemplation, the great god Shiva, upon granting a boon to a demon, feared turning to ashes himself and resorted to fleeing.
   
   Without contemplation, Vishnu once killed Bhrigu�s wife. As a result of the curse, he endured immense sorrow and suffered extremely unbearable distress.
   
   Thus, without contemplation, gods, deities, demons, humans, and animals all inevitably experience distress.
   
   O Bhargava, those wise ones who are never abandoned by contemplation are greatly fortunate. Salutations to them continually.
   
   Attaining duty without contemplation leads to delusion everywhere. By contemplating and acting, one is freed from all boundless distress.
   
   Thus, for a long time, people have been associated with a lack of contemplation. As long as contemplation is absent, where can reflection be found?
   
   In the summer, in a desert scorched by intense rays, where is cool water found? Similarly, one is engulfed by the enduring flames of lack of contemplation and impurities.
   
   Without the means, how would the cool touch of contemplation be experienced? Indeed, the means here is singular, supreme, and superior in every way.
   
   Without the supreme grace of the deity residing in the lotus of all hearts, how would anyone easily attain great welfare?
   
   The sun of contemplation dispels the great darkness of non-contemplation. There, the foundation lies in the devoted worship of the deity.
   
   
   
   When the supreme goddess is completely worshipped and pleased, she assumes the form of contemplation, like the sun illuminating the sky of the mind.
   
   Therefore, worship Tripura, the supreme goddess, dwelling within all, the great and auspicious goddess of consciousness.
   
   Worship gradually without deceit through the true guru. In worship, the root is devotion and pure faith.
   
   There too, the root is praised by hearing its greatness. Therefore, Rama, the greatness has been told to you first.
   
   By hearing that, you have now attained auspiciousness. Contemplation is the root of prosperity because you are without fear.
   
   Until the rise of contemplation, there is great fear, daily affected by the flaw of a lack of contemplation.
   
   Just as taking medicine affects disorder, so too would fear persist until the impurity of the element is removed.
   
   Life becomes fruitful for men upon attaining supreme contemplation, but in all births of men, supreme contemplation must be achieved.
   
   
   Many trees of birth are barren due to fruitlessness. That tree of birth becomes fruitful where there is contemplation.
   
   Men are like well-frogs without contemplation, much like a frog born in a well knows nothing beyond it.
   
   Good or bad, it perishes in the well. Similarly, people are born in vain in the well of the universe.
   
   Good or bad, they do not recognize themselves anywhere. Arising again and again, they perish, unaware of their own benefit.
   
   Recognizing happiness in sorrow and sorrow in happiness, due to the profound impact of a lack of contemplation, they are consumed in the fire of transmigration (cycle of birth and death).
   
   Afflicted by sorrow and unable to abandon it in any way, just like a stubborn donkey, even when struck by a hundred blows.
   
   People indeed follow the cycle of transmigration like donkeys. But you, O Rama, with contemplation, have transcended sorrow.

Thus ends the second chapter on the �Greatness of Contemplation� in the Knowledge Section of the revered Tripura Rahasya.
   

CHAPTER 3: GREATNESS OF ASSOCIATION WITH THE GOOD
   
   Intrigued by the words of Dattatreya, Jamadagni's son (Parashurama) humbly asked again, full of curiosity.
   
   O Lord, what you have spoken is indeed true. Without contemplation, people have brought about their own great destruction.
   
   By contemplation, prosperity would indeed be attained, and its cause is also heard. Hearing of this greatness is clearly indicated here, yet a great doubt persists.
   
   How can it be obtained, and what are the means? If it is natural, why is it not known to everyone?
   
   Until today, I have not found direction here. I have encountered more sorrow and have been defeated at every step.
   
   I have not found the means from anywhere; please tell me this. Thus asked, Dattatreya, the ocean of compassion, spoke again, pleased.
   
   
   Listen, O Rama, I will explain the ultimate cause of prosperity. The association with virtuous people is the fundamental root, leading to the elimination of all sorrow.
   
   In achieving the ultimate goal, the seed is believed to be the company of the virtuous. You too, through the association with the noble Samvarta, the great soul.
   
   Through his association, you have reached this state, experiencing the fruit of prosperity. Truly, the virtuous, when connected with, bestow supreme happiness.
   
   Who has ever attained supreme prosperity without the association of the virtuous? In the world, a person becomes what they are through the associations they keep.
   
   In every way, he attains that result, without a doubt. Now, listen, O Rama, as I narrate this story to you.
   
   Once, there was a king of Dasharna known as Muktachuda. He had two sons, Hemachuda and Manichuda.
   
   Both were handsome and virtuous, skilled in all knowledge. Once, driven by enthusiasm for hunting, they set out, surrounded by the army.
   
   
   
   They entered the formidable forest of the Sahya mountain, which was teeming with powerful lions, tigers, and other ferocious creatures, armed with bows and arrows.
   
   With their sharp arrows swiftly released from their bows, they killed deer, lions, boars, buffaloes, and wolves in that place.
   
   While the princes were engaged in killing wild animals, a fierce wind suddenly appeared, showering gravel and stones upon them.
   
   The sky was enveloped in dust, making it as dark as night. No rocks, trees, or people could be seen.
   
   With the mountain shrouded in darkness, how could one discern the heights from the depths? The army, struck by the shower of gravel, fled completely.
   
   Some sought shelter by trees, others by rocks or caves. Mounted on horses, the princes also fled far.
   
   Hemachuda eventually reached a hermitage of ascetics, surrounded by beautiful groves of plantains and date palms.
   
   There, he saw an auspicious girl, shining like a flame, her body glowing like heated gold.
   
   
   Seeing her, the prince smiled and asked, "Who are you, lotus-faced, in the forest?"
   
   Residing as if fearless in this desolate, fear-inducing place, to whom do you belong, and who has left you here alone? How is this possible?
   
   Questioned thus, the blameless girl spoke to the prince, "Welcome, prince, please take a seat."
   
   This is the duty of ascetics, indeed, to worship a guest. I see you are tired and distressed by the fierce wind.
   
   Tying the horse to a date palm tree, he sat there, relieved of his fatigue, and said, �You deserve to hear my story.�
   
   She gave him fruits to eat and juice to drink. Thus, the blameless girl helped the prince to rest.
   
   She spoke with a sweet, honey-flowing voice, "Prince, Vyaghrapada is the sage, a follower of Shiva."
   
   By whom the most virtuous worlds were conquered through the strength of his penance, the knower of the highest and lowest, always worshipped by the leaders of sages.
   
   I am rightly his daughter, known as Hemalekha, born of the virtuous Vidyutprabha, enchanting in all aspects.
   
   Once, while along the Vena river, she came to bathe. Consequently, Sushena, the king of Vanga, arrived there.
   
   He saw her, a beauty of the world, bathing in the river, her pair of breasts clearly outlined through the wet cloth.
   
   Struck by love�s arrow, he desired her then and there; she, captivated by his words, accepted.
   
   United with her, the king returned to his city. The virtuous one, bearing the strength of the rajarishi, also conceived.
   
   Fearing she might offend her husband, she came here and abandoned the pregnancy. Born of the rajarishi�s unfailing strength, I am the girl from then.
   
   Vyaghrapada saw me during the evening worship, and with compassion, he took me in and protected me like a mother.
   
   By duty, he who is called a protector, indeed like a father. I am his rightful daughter, devoted to serving him.
   
   By his greatness, I have no fear here or anywhere. This place is never invaded by gods, demons, or evil minds.
   
   You may be worthy to enter the hermitage, but upon entering, you will attain no fear. This is my story stated. Stay a little, prince.
   
   The venerable father will arrive; behold him. Bow to him, receive his blessings, and then you may depart in the morning.
   
   Hearing Hemalekha�s words and captivated by her beauty, he became somewhat fearful and appeared uneasy, as if hesitant to proceed further.
   
   Then, observing the prince under the sway of desire, the wise girl spoke again, �Prince, regain your composure.�
   
   "Father is coming soon; then seek what you desire." As she was speaking, the great sage Vyaghrapada arrived.
   
   He arrived from the forest, gathering leaves and flowers. Seeing the sage approaching, the prince stood up.
   
   Bowing and announcing his name, he sat down as instructed. Then, noticing the prince�s appearance distorted by desire.
   
   Perceiving everything with his yogic vision and deeming it appropriate, the sage gave Hemalekha to him in marriage.
   
   
   
   The delighted prince, taking her with him, returned to the city. Muktachuda, filled with joy, celebrated their union with great festivity.
   
   The king performed the marriage ceremony according to the customs. Subsequently, the prince was always engaged in playful activities with her.
   In palaces, forests, and riverbanks, the prince spent time with Hemalekha, who was not particularly desirous of worldly pleasures.
   
   Seeing her always indifferent, he asked privately, �Dear, why are you not affectionate towards me when I am so affectionate to you?�
   
   My dear, with a pure smile, why are you not extremely attached to enjoyments? Are the enjoyments not appealing to you here? Why is this?
   
   In these excellent enjoyments, you seem not to be attached to me. Without your attachment, how can my love be pleasing?
   
   Though I am attached to you, your mind seems to be elsewhere. Even when I speak repeatedly, you appear not to hear anything.
   
   Even after a long time, when I arrive and embrace your neck, you ask, 'When did you come, my lord?' as if unaware.
   
   In these rare and pleasing enjoyments, your mind is not attached at all. Why do you not approve of anything?
   
   In these moments when I approach and find you alone, with closed eyes, it feels as if you are dwelling in a different world, far from me.
   
   Indifferent to enjoyments and objects, how can my happiness flourish, as if I were connected to a lifeless wooden doll?
   
   Not abandoning your wish, my own intention holds no significance. I follow you entirely, just as the lotus follows the moonlight.
   
   Thus, please tell me where your mind dwells, my dear, for whom you are dearer than life. By understanding this, my own mind may be purified. I earnestly request you, my beloved.
   
   Thus ends the third chapter on the �Greatness of Association with the Good� in the Knowledge Section of the revered Tripura Rahasya.

CHAPTER 4: FRUIT OF ASSOCIATION WITH THE GOOD
   
   Embracing his neck, she listened to her dear�s words and, with a slight smile, spoke to the prince, who was blameless.
   
   Desiring to enlighten the prince with reason, she said: �Prince, listen to my words, I am not indifferent to you.�
   
   What is most dear in the world and what is not? Deep thinking always falls short of reaching an end here; this is my thought.
   
   I have contemplated this for a long time, always reflecting on it as a woman. I do not know this truth; please tell me sincerely.
   
   Thus spoken, Hemachuda, smiling, said to his beloved, �Indeed, women are foolish; this is undoubtedly true.�
   
   Indeed, animals, birds, and reptiles understand what is dear and not dear, as evidenced by their behavior towards those things.
   
   Engagement and disengagement, what is there to think much about it? Happiness makes something dear, while sorrow makes it not dear.
   
   Why do you always ponder in bewilderment, dear? Hearing these words, Hemalekha again spoke to her beloved.
   
   It is true that women often seem bewildered and lack proper contemplation. Yet, I should be enlightened by you with the right contemplation.
   
   Once well enlightened by you, I will leave this worry behind. With your guidance, I will find daily enjoyment thereafter.
   
   O king, indeed, happiness and sorrow become yours through the discernment of what is dear and not dear by means of subtle contemplation.
   
   Indeed, one�s happiness and sorrow are shaped by variations in time, place, and form. Why is that considered the basis here?
   
   Because fire produces different results depending on time, it similarly varies based on place and form.
   
   In cold weather, fire is cherished, but in heat, it is certainly not. The same holds true in places with cold and hot climates; its value fluctuates accordingly.
   
   For beings of cold nature, fire is cherished, while for others, it is not. This illustrates that its value varies significantly, either increasing or decreasing in different degrees.
   
   Similarly, wealth, wives, sons, kingdoms, and other possessions are cherished, even by a great king surrounded by such abundance.
   
   Why does he grieve daily, while others do not? The pursuit of happiness through enjoyment is an endless endeavor.
   
   That complete happiness has not been attained by anyone. Even the small amount of happiness that is gained, listen about that as well.
   
   Happiness does not remain happiness, lord, when it is mixed with sorrow. Sorrow is said to be of two kinds: external and internal.
   
   External sorrow arises from the body due to an imbalance of elements and similar factors. Internal sorrow is said to be mental, originating from desires.
   
   The intense mental suffering that grips the world is indeed rooted in desire, which is the powerful seed of the tree of sorrow.
   
   By desire, they serve and attain, working day and night. This is well-known even for Indra and the wise ones dwelling in heaven.
   
   O prince, the happiness that remains even after the fulfillment of desire, recognize that as the sorrow that even worms experience.
   

   The happiness of animals, insects, worms, and others, combined with small desires, is greater. Tell me, what is the happiness of men when they possess only small desires?
   
   If someone filled with hundreds of desires achieves something, they might find happiness here, wouldn't you agree?
   
   If an entire body is burned by fire, and a small drop of sandalwood paste cools it, then he would find happiness in that small relief.
   
   A man finds true happiness in the embrace of his beloved. Yet, when separated, the physical disconnect brings inevitable sorrow due to the awkward detachment of their bodies.
   
   From the intensity of pleasure, exhaustion arises in everyone. Subsequently, the fatigue is akin to that of a burdened beast.
   
   How can this be seen as happiness, lord? Explain it to me: as long as happiness arises from the beloved's company, merely through the friction of nerves.
   
   Is your happiness not akin to that of dogs here? Then, indeed, your happiness from perceived beauty must be far greater.
   
   That happiness arises only from ego, like in a dream where one unites with a woman. Long ago, there was a prince, more beautiful than Cupid.
   
   A prince, more beautiful than Cupid, obtained an all-enchanting woman and became extremely attached to her.
   
   Her mind, however, was attached to another�the prince's servant. The servant cunningly deceived the prince with a trick.
   
   He gave the prince an excessive amount of wine to enchant him, and then sent an unattractive maidservant to the now-intoxicated prince.
   
   He enjoyed her, believing she was his wife, the most beautiful woman in the world. Blinded by intoxication, the prince lingered in this illusion for a long time.
   
   Each day, as he approached the maidservant, he considered himself fortunate, thinking, "I am blessed to have such a beautiful beloved in the world."
   
   "I approach her daily, I have no equal anywhere." One day, by divine intervention...
   
   The servant placed the drink and hurried off to attend to an urgent matter. The prince drank the beverage, not excessively.
   
   Driven by his desire, he quickly went to the bed, his mind filled with pleasure and delight, enjoying the prosperity of his indulgences.
   
   In a palace resembling the abode of the gods in Nandana, he approached the maidservant on the bed, mistaking her for the princess.
   
   Overwhelmed by the force of desire, he indulged in extreme pleasure. At the end of this pleasure, he discovered that she was a maidservant with a distorted appearance.
   
   Suspicious and indignant, he thought, "What is this? Where is my beloved?" and questioned her in this manner.
   
   Being questioned by him, the maidservant, observing his sober state, was indeed frightened. Trembling and unable to speak, she remained silent.
   
   Noticing the trouble and self-deception, the prince, his eyes red with anger, grabbed the maidservant�s hair with his left hand.
   
   Taking the sword in his right hand, the prince, threatening her, said, �Speak the truth of what happened.�
   
   "Otherwise, your life will not last even for a moment.� Frightened by his words and eager to save her life, she began to speak.
   
   She recounted everything that had transpired over time and showed him his wife's association with the servant.
   
   On the ground lay the servant, dark with brown eyes, tall, with filthy limbs, and a harsh, disgusting face.
   
   Embracing her, exhausted from pleasure, with all his limbs in a feeling of love, his neck encircled by her soft arms, lay his own wife.
   
   Placing his face like a lotus at her feet, embracing her tightly, his hands clasping her thighs, and her heavy breasts pressing against him.
   
   The prince saw her like a spring creeper covered with clusters of flowers, reminiscent of Rohini being eclipsed by Rahu.
   
   Seeing her in this state, unconscious in sleep and profoundly deluded, the prince paused for a moment before regaining his composure.
   
   Hear what the prince spoke, indeed, "Shame on me, so utterly ignoble, foolish, intoxicated, and deluded."
   
   Shame on those deeply attached to women, shame on those lowest of men. Women are not anyone�s, like starlings on a tree.
   
   What can I say about myself, foolish like a buffalo calf, believing her to be dearer than life, thinking she was my beloved for so long?
   
   Women are like a prostitute to a rogue, belonging to no one. Indeed, a man who trusts women is like a wild donkey.
   
   The state of an autumn cloud is momentary and unstable. Even more fleeting is the extremely fickle nature of women.
   
   Alas, until today, I did not understand the true nature of women. While I was completely devoted to her, she abandoned me and devoted herself to a mere servant.
   
   Attached to another, greedy in mind, showing insincere love for me, she displayed her devotion like an actress performing in an actor�s troupe.
   
   With my mind clouded by wine, I didn't truly know her, believing she was attached to me like a shadow, confidently trusting her in my heart.
   
   Who on earth could be more foolish than I, deceived and long-associated with that unattractive maidservant?
   
   Who, with confidence, was long deceived by her? Alas, this wretched servant with a distorted form.
   
   What beauty did she see in this wretched servant, more than in anyone else, even if my own beauty was considered world-renowned?
   
   Entirely attached to the servant, she abandoned me and approached him. Thus, lamenting in various ways, he became extremely disillusioned.
   
   
   The prince went to the forest, free from all attachments. Therefore, O prince, understand that this beauty arises from the mind.
   
   Just as you once found extreme pleasure in me due to my exceptional beauty, so too, in the same manner,
   
   Many find extreme pleasure even in deformed women. Here, I will give you assurance. Listen attentively, dear.
   
   A woman is perceived as externally well-formed, but this appearance is merely a reflection of her own self-image residing in the mind.
   
   Her beauty is repeatedly envisioned in the mind as a form of desire. Once that desire is achieved, it fulfills the mental image formed.
   
   A man with agitated senses finds pleasure in her everywhere. However, if his senses are calm, he would not derive pleasure even from her beauty.
   
   The constant reiteration of her beauty is the root cause of agitation. However, this agitation is not observed in children or even in yogis.
   
   Likewise, a man describes beauty wherever he finds pleasure, whether in a beautiful person or someone else.
   
   Women with unattractive forms are often seen associated with young men for the sake of having children.
   
   If there is an emphasis on deformity or a lack of praise for beauty, how could men find pleasure in either?
   
   What can be said, alas, of men with lustful, distracted minds? Beauty seems to shine everywhere, even in the least attractive parts.
   
   If someone finds beauty even in parts smeared with filth and urine, then where would beauty not shine?
   
   Therefore, observe this beauty, O prince. Without pride, it can never be the cause of happiness anywhere.
   
   If beauty in the body is like the sweetness of honey, then why does it not shine in children or boys in the same way?
   
   In different regions, men with various physical forms are observed: one-legged, one-eyed, long-eared, and horse-faced.
   
   Covered in hair, reverse-haired, with ears over the forehead, protruding teeth, without a nose, or with long noses.
   
   With tawny hair, white hair, disheveled hair, thick hair, leprosy spots, crow-colored skin, yellowish, and reddish-bodied.
   
   Thus, various mortals find pleasure among women of their own kind. Observe this, O prince.
   
   In sources of pleasure, the primary one is the female form, cherished by all, where even the wise are led astray.
   
   ikewise, consider the forms of men and women, immensely beautiful and cherished, endowed with good intellect, as they are, O prince.
   
   Smeared with flesh, soaked in blood, bound by veins, covered with skin, a skeleton covered with hair, filled with bile and phlegm.
   
   Filled with filth and urine, born of semen and blood, arising from the urinary passage�alas, this is what is desired here.
   
   Men who indulge in pleasure under such extremely repulsive conditions�tell me, how are they different from worms in excrement?
   
   O prince, this body is extremely dear to you. Consider with discernment the separate existence of its elements.
   
   Thus, consider the nature of sweet, sour, and other tastes. Similarly, reflect on the six tastes elsewhere. Indeed, view them with a subtle vision.
   
   Even the food that is eaten, in every way, ultimately transforms into excrement, a truth known by all without doubt.
   
   Tell me, thus established in the world, what would be dear and what not dear? Thus spoken, Hemachuda then realized indifference in the subject.
   
   Upon hearing the unprecedented speech, he was immediately astonished and reflected deeply on everything Hemalekha had said.
   
   With disinterest in pleasures now arisen, he attained supreme detachment. Then, gradually, he asked his beloved, seeking to understand that state.

   Realizing the consciousness established in the self, Tripura as the essence of the self, he became a liberated soul, perceiving everything as the self.
   
   He attained liberation while living. Following him, his younger brother Manicuda also realized this truth through his brother's guidance. Subsequently, Muktacuda too realized it from his son.
   
   Manicuda�s beloved also attained knowledge from the daughter-in-law. Ministers and citizens too became enlightened.
   
   No one in that city was born ignorant. It became known as Brahma�s city, an abode of peaceful cycles of birth and death.
   
   That great city stood out brilliantly in the world, where even parrots and mynah birds recited scriptures from their cages.
   
   Worship your own self as the embodiment of consciousness, devoid of any external awareness. There is no awareness separate from consciousness, just as a reflection in a mirror is not separate from the mirror itself.
   
   I am consciousness, pure awareness. All moving and non-moving entities follow and are illuminated by consciousness, shining independently in its presence.
   
   Therefore, people, abandon delusion and worship the all�encompassing, radiant consciousness with a clear vision of pure awareness.
   
   Once, upon hearing the magnificent speech of the parrots, the Brahmins, led by Vamadeva, proclaimed the name of the city.
   
   Since even the animals here recite knowledge, let this city be renowned as the 'Famous City of Knowledge.'
   
   Even today, that city retains its name. O Rama, this is why association with the virtuous is indeed the foundation for all auspiciousness.
   
   By associating with Hemalekha, everyone gained knowledge. Therefore, O Rama, understand that such association is the ultimate root of prosperity.

Thus ends the fourth chapter on the �Fruit of Association with the Good� in the Story of Hemachuda in the Knowledge Section of the revered Tripura Rahasya.
   

CHAPTER 5: STORY OF BONDAGE IN TALE OF HEMACHUDA
   
   Hearing about the greatness of good company from the son of Atri, Rama was delighted in mind and began to ask further questions.
   
   What you say is true, O lord, as the cause of auspiciousness, this form of good company is indeed realized through direct experience.
   
   As one attains association, so would be the fruit of that. Women, through their association with Hemalekha, also obtained great benefits.
   
   Again, I desire to hear how Hemachuda was enlightened by her. Please tell me that in detail, O ocean of compassion.
   
   Thus questioned by Rama, Dattatreya spoke to him. "Listen, O descendant of Bhrigu, I will tell you the supremely purifying story."
   
   Thus, hearing her words and realizing the objects to be devoid of real essence, he became disinterested and disheartened.
   
   Dominated by long-standing sensory desires, he found it difficult to suddenly abandon or control them.
   
   The prince, deeply ashamed, said nothing to his beloved. Troubled in thought, he spent several days in this state.
   
   Though still attached to the objects of his desires, he could not forget the woman's words. Condemning himself, he continued to indulge, yet remained under the sway of his desires.
   
   Driven by desire, he pursued worldly objects, yet the awareness of their flaws lingered in his mind, reminding him of his beloved's wise words.
   
   His heart, gripped by sorrow, grieved repeatedly. Consequently, his mind became like a cradle, constantly swinging between distress and contemplation.
   
   Nothing could please him, not food, clothes, ornaments, women, vehicles, friends, or companions.
   
   As if he had lost all his wealth, he grieved continuously. Controlled by desires, he could not abandon everything quickly.
   
   Unable to find joy and afflicted by faults, he was overwhelmed by sorrow, appearing pale-faced.
   
   Hemalekha, noticing his change, met him in private and asked, "Why, my lord, do you not appear as joyful as you once were?"
   
   I see you as if you are grieving. Why is your state like this? Is your body always afflicted by diseases?
   
   n enjoyments, the wise ones say there is indeed a fear of disease, caused by the imbalance of the three doshas in the body.
   
   Diseases commonly afflict all bodies and become established. The imbalance caused by the doshas is truly difficult to manage in every way.
   
   From food, clothes, words, sight, touch, and also from time, place, and actions, the doshas become imbalanced.
   
   Therefore, its occurrence in the world often goes unnoticed in every way. Thus, when imbalanced, treatment is prescribed.
   
   Treatment is not prescribed in the absence of imbalance. Therefore, dear, tell me why there is sorrow within you.
   
   Upon hearing Hemalekha, the prince responded, "Dear, listen, I will tell you the cause of my sorrow."
   
   By your words, that which once brought me happiness is now gone. Indeed, I no longer see anything that increases my joy.
   
   The objects bestowed by the king, which once brought happiness, now do not please me at all. Therefore, my happiness has vanished.
   
   Serving the objects always, like a condemned person, I ask you, dear, tell me, what should I do to attain happiness?
   
   Questioned thus by him, Hemalekha said to herself, "Surely, he has rightly concluded by hearing my words"
   
   There is a seed for prosperity in this, given your present state. For those in whom such prosperity is inconceivable, they remain unaffected even by words.
   
   Indeed, those for whom the well-worshipped deity residing in the heart is pleased are not specially affected at any time, not even a little.
   
   Considering Tripura to be such a state, the very wise Hemalekha, intending to enlighten her dear, spoke further.
   
   Concealing her wisdom, she indirectly said, "Listen, prince, to this ancient tale of mine."
   
   Formerly, my mother gave me a friend to play with. Though naturally virtuous, she eventually associated with someone unvirtuous.
   
   She, endowed with various extraordinary creations, unnoticed by my mother, began associating with my friend.
   
   My friend, deeply involved in bad conduct, was dearer to me than life itself. I was always under her influence.
   
   I couldn't abandon her even for a moment, nor could she ever part from me for even half a moment. Due to her pure nature, she continually exerted control over me.
   
   Continuously absorbed in her, I naturally adopted her ways. She was often seen with a dancer of varied nature.
   
   She was engaged in remote activities, under the direction of her son (Son of my mother). Her son, who was very foolish and often intoxicated, had eyes rolling in inebriation.
   
   He forcibly enjoyed her, always in my presence. She, with all her limbs seized by him, was subjected to his desires daily.
   
   She never left me, despite being touched by him, and I didn�t leave her either. Then, a son was born to the fool, resembling him in appearance.
   
   He quickly grew up, exhibiting a very fickle nature, inheriting his father's foolishness and the qualities of his grandmother.
   
   Surrounded by the ability to create many wonders, due to the grandmother named Shunya and the father named Mudha.
   
   Named Asthira, he trained extensively and became highly skilled, quickly achieving unimpeded and rapid movement.
   
   Thus, my friend, who was pure-natured and virtuous by birth, became excessively impure through association with the unvirtuous.
   
   Through prolonged association with her dear friend's unvirtuous-natured son, she became strongly attached to them.
   
   My friend gradually withdrew all affection for me, but being naturally simple, I found it difficult to easily break away from that association.
   
   Due to my deep devotion, I was unable to completely abandon her and continued to follow. Her foolish companion, constantly enjoying her, was always present.
   
   Forcibly eager to completely assault me, I, being naturally pure, never truly fell under his control.
   
   Even so, great slander about me became widespread in the world. "She is completely enjoyed by the fool," thus it was said everywhere.
   
   Placing her son named Asthira in my care, my friend, fully embraced by her beloved, devoted herself completely to him.
   
   Then Asthira, well cherished and nurtured by me, grew up and began associating with a woman with his grandmother's permission.
   
   She, his dear one named Capal?, changed her form every moment, each appearance delightful and pleasing to him.
   
   While holding her dear one, she created wonders and kept him under her control. Using her skills and expertise, she skillfully guided him.
   
   Asthira, even in a moment, travels hundreds of yojanas continuously without fatigue.
   
   Whenever Asthira desires to go anywhere, Capal?, by her expertise, takes on the desired form and accompanies him.
   
   Wherever they go, she remains close, pleasing her beloved. Thus, Capal?, well joined with Asthira, stayed loyal and devoted.
   
   She gave birth to five sons, devoted to their mother and father. These capable sons, of five different types, were placed in me by my friend.
   
   I, being attached to my friend, nurtured and strengthened them. Then, those five sons of Capal?, each grew independently.
   
   They constructed a magnificent and spacious dwelling. Their father, under their influence, was well-inspired by the mother.
   
   They bring their father to their dwelling moment by moment. Asthira resides in the eldest son's dwelling.
   
   He heard a variety of sounds, both melodious and otherwise. In some places, there was sweet music; in others, very pleasant instrumental tunes.
   
   He heard Rigveda hymns, Yajurveda hymns, Samaveda hymns, Atharvaveda hymns, mantras, scriptures, doctrines, histories, and the jingling of ornaments.
   
   He heard the song of the swarm of bees and the melodious fifth note of the cuckoo, thus he heard delightful sounds at the direction of the son.
   
   Delighted, he submitted to the control of the son. Then the son directed otherwise, exposing him to harsh, ear-piercing, and terrifying sounds.
   
   He heard the terrifying roar of lions, the rumble of thunderclouds, the cracking of the universe, and the cries of miscarriage, all extremely frightening.
   
   Hearing these sounds, he became very frightened. Elsewhere, he heard weeping, lamenting, and various expressions of grief.
   
   Led by the second son, Asthira then went to that dwelling, where he saw seats that were soft to the touch and auspicious.
   
   He saw beds and clothes that felt rough, objects that were cool to the touch, and also items that were warm to the touch.
   
   Observing various objects that felt neither warm nor cool, beneficial ones brought him joy, while harmful ones caused him distress.
   
   Then, upon reaching the third son's dwelling, Asthira saw beautiful forms and objects in various colors.
   
   Red, white, yellow, and blue, green, pink, as well as smoky, dark, brown, metallic, and mottled.
   
   Thick, thin, small, long, extended, round, as well as semi-circular, elongated circular, beautiful, and frightening.
   
   Repulsive, shining, fierce, obscure, and dazzling. Some were beneficial, and seeing others from there, the father again.
   
   The fourth son led him to his wonderful dwelling. There, he obtained flowers, fruits, and food step by step.
   
   Drinks, licked and sucked food, juicy indeed, nectar-like, sweet, and other sour tastes.
   
   Pungent and bitter, astringent as well, some alkaline, sweet and sour, pungent, sour, and salty.
   
   Pungent and bitter, variously flavored, different as well, tasting them together with the son, and then the last son.
   
   The last son brought the father to his own place, extremely wonderful. There, he obtained many flowers and fruits.
   
   Herbs, food, medicinal plants, and other objects from all sides: fragrant, foul-smelling, mild-smelling, and strong-smelling.
   
   Deluding scents, knowledge-enhancing scents, fainting-inducing scents, various other scents. Thus, he entered and resided in the dwellings of the sons.
   
   He delights in beneficial things in some places and grieves over harmful things in others. Always engaged in coming and going, he appeared in the dwellings of his sons.
   
   The sons, out of affection for their father, are never without him. They never touch various objects or act on their own at any time.
   
   Asthira, having enjoyed many objects in his son's house, secretly takes some objects back to his own place.
   
   Asthira, together with his wife Chapala, secretly indulge there without the sons, always excessively.
   
   Soon, Mahasana (his new wife) became attached to her beloved husband, Asthira. Asthira also became excessively attached to her.
   
   Then, for her pleasure, he was determined to provide enjoyment. She consumed everything he brought her in an instant.
   
   Overwhelmed by hunger for more enjoyment, she constantly urges her dear one to get more, prompting him to continually seek additional pleasures.
   
   Brought by the five sons and well-provided by her dear one, she consumed it all in a moment, only to be tormented by hunger once more.
   
   To obtain enjoyment, she constantly directs her dear one and his sons. Soon after, she gave birth to a pair of sons.
   
   
   Jwalamukha, the elder of the two, and Nindya Vrtta, the younger, were always the most dear to their mother.
   
   When Asthira embraces her with great attachment, Jwalamukha's flames consume his entire body.
   
   Asthira, extremely tormented, often falls into deep unconsciousness. Sometimes, he associates with his dear son, Nindya Vrtta.
   
   Blamed by everyone, he becomes like the dead. Thus, due to the sorrow caused by his sons, my friend is extremely distressed.
   
   My dear friend, naturally pure and out of great affection for her son Asthira, was associated with him and distressed by sorrow.
   
   Overwhelmed by the burden of sorrow, associated with Nindya Vrtta, Jwalamukha, and others, being embraced by his sons.
   
   Badly burnt and blamed by people, she indeed became almost dead. Always following her, I too became almost lost, dear.
   
   Thus, distressed by the sorrow of my friend for many years, Asthira also became dependent, being dedicated to Mahasana.
   
   He reached the city with ten gates through some action somewhere. There, he was associated with Mahasana due to his sons, mother, and others.
   
   He dwelled there, desiring happiness but experiencing sorrow day and night. His body was burnt all over by his sons, and he was blamed daily.
   
   Dragged here and there by his dear ones, always indeed. He entered and resided in the five dwellings of his sons.
   
   Extremely fatigued, he finds no happiness anywhere. Thus, due to the sorrow of her son, my friend is deeply distressed.
   
   She became almost unconscious and dwelled in that city, deeply attached to Jwalamukha and Nindya Vrtta.
   
   They were nourished by Shunyakya (the grandmother) and the foolish father-in-law, was also greatly supported by his wife, Chapala.
   
   Residing in that city, she was under the control of her husband and Asthira. Out of affection for my friend, I lived there, devoted to her.
   
   Almost destroyed by the sorrow of my friend, yet intent on protecting everyone. If I were not there even for a moment, dear,
   
   There would be no one, and indeed, I protect everyone. Shunyakya provided emptiness, just as foolishness is imparted by the foolish.
   
   Asthira brought instability and fickleness, being associated with Chapala. Jwalamukha caused burning, and Nindya Vrtta defined his identity.
   
   By associating with my friend, I took on this particular form. If I were to leave my friend, that form would perish in a moment.
   
   By associating with them, I am indeed called unfaithful. All the foolish people think so, but the wise know me as pure.
   
   My mother, the great chaste one, pure and spotless in form, is even vaster than the sky and subtler than an atom.
   
   All-knowing, yet knowing nothing; all-doer, yet inactive; support of all, yet unsupported; foundation of all, yet unfounded.
   
   Having all forms, yet formless; possessing everything, yet unconnected; shining everywhere, yet unknown by anyone, anywhere.
   
   Although full of great joy, she is devoid of joy. She is without mother and father, yet she has countless children like me.
   
   Like the countless waves of the ocean, all are a group of sisters, all of them behaving like me, O prince, indeed.
   
   I, possessing a great mantra, am associated with all these groups of friends. Devoted to them, I am also like a mother in essence.
   
   In this city, when the son of my friend becomes very tired, Asthira sleeps completely in his mother's lap.
   
   But when Asthira is asleep, his sons and others also fall asleep; no one else remains awake.
   
   Then the dear friend named Pracara protects the city of Asthira, always moving around the pair of eastern gates.
   
   The mother of Asthira, who is my friend, is naturally an unchaste mother-in-law due to her son and her husband.
   
   She, covering them all, protects them along with her son. Thus, when everyone is asleep, I then reach my own mother.
   
   I become delighted, embraced by the mother for a long time. But again, I quickly follow them when they arise daily.
   
   This mighty friend of Asthira, named Pracara, nourishes all, led by Asthira, daily.
   
   He, becoming many from one, pervades and protects the city and its inhabitants daily, uniting them all.
   
   Without him, they would indeed be separated and completely lost, like pearls in a garland without the thread to string them together.
   
   Thus, he greatly joins and unites me with everyone, greatly enlivened by me, truly the thread bearer in that city.
   
   But when that city grows old, he quickly moves them to another city. Thus, relying on Pracara, he became the ruler of cities.
   
   Indeed, the chaste son Asthira, though dependent, is mighty and gradually becomes unstable in many diverse ways.
   
   Extremely influenced by me in every way, he bears the suffering from his unions with Chapala and Mahashana.
   
   Dragged everywhere by his sons Jwalamukha and Nindya Vrtta, as well as by the other five sons.
   
   An afflicted soul in great distress, devoid of the slightest happiness, he is dragged here and there by his five sons.
   
   Somewhere he is extremely moved by Chapala, afflicted with fatigue, and elsewhere he runs for food due to Mahashana.
   
   Somewhere moved by Jwalamukha, burned from head to toe, he falls into a deep faint, unaware of any remedy.
   
   Accompanied by Nindya Vrtta somewhere, he is reproached and scolded by others, considering himself like the dead and continuously in grief.
   
   With a bad wife and sons, deluded and born into a troubled family, he is always overwhelmed and led by them.
   
   He lived with them in various cities, both high and low, and sometimes in wild regions filled with carnivorous beings.
   
   Sometimes in extremely hot places, sometimes in extremely cold ones, sometimes in foul-smelling areas, and sometimes in dense darkness.
   
   Thus, once again with great sorrow, afflicted by her son Asthira, my friend became deeply distressed, always in bad company.
   
   Though true to my nature, I foolishly followed her, dear, like a fool, extremely devoted to her family.
   
   Who indeed can obtain even a little happiness from bad association anywhere, like a man seeking cool comfort in a summer desert?
   
   Thus, after a long time, my friend, deluded by great sorrow, began to associate with me in private.
   
   Obtaining single-minded association with me, and having met a good husband, she conquered her son, binding and subduing his sons and others.
   
   Associating with me, she quickly reached my mother�s city, repeatedly embracing my pure mother.
   
   Immersed in the ocean of bliss, she became that instantly. Thus, you too should control the bad conduct arising from your friend.
   
   By obtaining your mother, Lord, you will always find happiness. This is shared with you, Lord, as a source of happiness I have experienced myself.

Thus ends the fifth chapter on the �Story of Bondage in the tale of Hemachuda� in the Knowledge Section of the revered Tripura Rahasya.
   

CHAPTER 6: PRAISE OF FAITH
   
   Hearing these sweet words, Hemachuda, very surprised and still ignorant, laughed and asked his dear and wise companion.
   
   Dear, what you have spoken seems strange to me and unsupported; today, I understand this completely.
   
   Surely, you are born of a nymph and raised by a sage in the forest. You have not yet fully reached adulthood and are still in budding youth.
   
   You speak words that resemble the speech of a possessed being, claiming to have lived for many thousands of years.
   
   Without context, how can I truly understand this? Tell me, where is your friend, and where is the friend's son bound?
   
   How old are they, and where are they established? Even so, what about that event? Tell me, where is that friend?
   
   I believe that I have not found any such friend of my mother, a noble lady in seclusion, nor my own, nor my father's, nor anyone else dear to me.
   
   Where is my friend or her son? Tell me quickly. I think your words are like a barren woman's son�nonexistent in the world.
   
   Your words are like an actor speaking in jest or like the son of a barren woman riding an illusory great chariot.
   
   Or like adorning the body with oyster shells made to look like golden ornaments, or fighting with weapons made from human horns in the sky forest.
   
   Having killed the future king and won the celestial city, or indeed playing with dream maidens in the stream of illusion.
   
   Thus, I think your words are entirely unrelated. Hearing this, she cleverly responded to him again.
   
   Lord, how can what I have spoken to you be meaningless? The words of people like me are never unsupported anywhere.
   
   Falsehood is indeed the destroyer of ascetics; where is it among those of truthful character? Why would falsehood exist in the family of ascetics, akin to beauty in a corpse?
   
   Whoever falsely engages the inquisitive for other purposes finds neither the upward nor the downward world as a means of happiness.
   
   Listen, prince, to my words: sometimes in this world, a blind person does not quickly attain vision, even with the application of medicinal eyewash.
   
   The foolish mind knows only falsehood and not beneficial words. Dear, why would I deceive you, the inquisitive, with falsehoods?
   
   Even if I have spoken falsehood, consider it with a sound mind. Indeed, in this world, a skilled mortal excels in all conduct.
   
   By examining a part, one can understand the whole. Let me give you an example; observe here.
   
   Which object was previously the means to the desired goal? For so long, it was my words. So how can they not be a means of happiness today?
   
   How does he now accomplish happiness in others? You should understand your belief through this example.
   
   Listen, O king, to what I say with a straightforward and pure intellect. In this world, a distrustful enemy becomes firm through trustworthy sayings.
   
   Faith, like a loving mother, always protects the surrendered one from great fears in every way; indeed, there is no doubt about this.
   
   Prosperity, happiness, and fame abandon the foolish and faithless and favor those who are trustworthy. He who is without faith becomes entirely devoid of these.
   
   Faith is indeed the nourisher of the worlds, faith is the life of all. Tell me, how can a faithless child live with the mother in this matter?
   
   How can a faithless young man flourish with happiness with his wife? Similarly, how can an old man follow the virtuous path without faith in his children?
   
   Why would a faithless farmer plow the earth? Without faith, there would be no activity anywhere, neither in renunciation nor in acquisition.
   
   Without faith, the existence of the worlds would perish. Listen, if worldly activity arises from complete acceptance.
   
   Even in complete acceptance, why is faith necessary? There too, the sole refuge is indeed faith itself.
   
   Therefore, without faith, the world would surely perish, just like it would without breathing. So, obtain firm faith and seek ultimate happiness.
   
   If you think faith should not be placed in the lowly, listen. Any activity indeed exists by faith, O prince.
   
   Hearing his beloved's words, Hemachuda said again to the skilled speaker, "How would your activity be thus, my dear?"
   
   Indeed, dear, faith should be placed in every way when it is to be placed in faith. Faith should be placed in the good, by which welfare is attained.
   
   Faith should not be placed in the bad by one who desires welfare. Otherwise, it is like a sharp, crooked hook inside.
   
   Just as fish meet their destruction by well�ground bait outside, so should faith be placed in the good, not in untruth anywhere.
   
   Those who placed faith in the bad met with destruction, as did others. Conversely, those who placed faith in the good attained welfare and prosperity.
   
   Therefore, placing faith properly is essential. Thus, you asked, "How would your activity be thus?"
   
   Thus spoken, Hemalekha said again to her dear husband, "Listen, O prince, to these words I am saying."
   
   You asked this question, "how." To that, I say to you, "How certain are you about this being or non-being?"
   
   If there is certainty in the truth, it should indeed become good with faith here. That would also be characterized if faith is associated with characteristics.
   
   If knowledge of characteristics comes from evidence, then listen to this: What evidence is there for one who lacks faith? Let that be well examined.
   
   Otherwise, the knower would not be contradicted anywhere. Therefore, the entire world operates by relying on faith.
   
   I will explain that method; listen with a steady mind. It concerns unsettled reasoning or the absence of reasoning altogether, in every way.
   
   The world would not attain welfare here or hereafter without reasoning. Sometimes, welfare may come by chance without reasoning.
   
   For unsettled reasoning, welfare would not come in any way. Once upon a time, on the Sahya mountain by the Godavari river, there was a sage named Kaushika.
   
   He lived with a calm mind, knowing the true nature of the world. Hundreds of his disciples stayed under the guru�s guidance.
   
   One day, they approached the guru to understand the state of the world according to their intellect, and then they spoke to each other.
   
   A highly learned Brahmin named Shunga arrived. With his skill in reasoning, he refuted the stated opinions of all.
   
   Then, without faith and having lost wisdom but still skillful in debate, he said among the Brahmins, "Truth is what is measured from evidence."
   
   Relying solely on unsettled reasoning, Shunga refuted everyone in the debate.
   
   "O Brahmins, listen to my words. Truth is nowhere established. What is measured by evidence is said to be the truth."
   
   There, indeed, due to that defect, it would be immeasurable. First, the flawlessness of the evidence should be ascertained.
   
   Thus, even that created by other evidence should be considered. Therefore, from uncertainty, nothing can be measured.
   
   Therefore, the knower, the measured, and the evidence do not establish anything. Consequently, based on emptiness, various alternatives indeed exist.
   
   Even he attained a state of emptiness due to the lack of evidence. Therefore, nothingness and emptiness are real; thus, this is the conclusion.
   
   Thus, hearing Shunga's words, some lowly Brahmins among them followed him, becoming proponents of emptiness with apparent certainty.
   
   Those devoted to that belief went to destruction, attaining a state of emptiness. The Brahmins with strong hearts rejected Shunga's words.
   
   By analyzing Kaushika's teachings, they became composed at heart, thereby completely abandoning that unsettled reasoning.
   
   Reasoning that always depends on true scriptures will attain welfare. This is what Hemachuda was told by his extremely wise beloved.
   
   Once again, extremely astonished, he asked her, "Oh dear, I was unaware of your great wisdom before."
   
   Blessed are you, and blessed am I for having approached you. You say that with faith one attains all auspiciousness. How is that so?
   
   Where should faith be placed, and where is it not recommended? The multitude of scriptures and their contradictory meanings make this unclear.
   
   Due to the differing opinions of teachers and commentators, and the instability of one's own intellect, what should be accepted and what should not?
   
   What is dear to one is declared as certain, while another's view remains undecided, causing harm, dear one.
   
   No one reaches a definitive conclusion about what is true or not. He who claims that truth is emptiness criticizes another's belief in non-emptiness.
   
   How can one know that something seemingly unbelievable is consistent with the scriptures? Explain this correctly, dear. Indeed, you must have considered it.
   
   Thus ends the sixth chapter named "Praise of Faith" in the Story of Hemachuda in the Knowledge Section of the revered Tripura Rahasya.
   
   

CHAPTER 7: DESCRIPTION OF THE NATURE OF GOD
   
   Thus questioned by her dearest husband, Hemalekha, wise and well-acquainted with the state of the world, replied appropriately.
   
   Listen, dearest, with a steady mind and respect, I will tell you. The mind is indeed always unstable, like a monkey.
   
   Because of this, ordinary people have experienced great misfortune. An unstable mind is recognized as the cause of all suffering.
   
   Because in deep sleep, the absence of movement brings happiness. Therefore, stabilize your mind and listen to what I have to say to you.
   
   What is heard with disrespect is as if unheard. It is absolutely fruitless, like seeking support from a painted tree.
   
   By abandoning unstable reasoning, which is destructive, people who rely on sound reasoning quickly obtain good results.
   
   By relying on sound reasoning, one quickly becomes dedicated to a single path. Having attained faith generated by sound reasoning, a person bears fruit here.
   
   Abandon that unstable reasoning and observe, dear, how this activity of the world becomes fruitful with faith.
   
   With sound reasoning over time, a farmer tills the earth. Similarly, with faith, one obtains silver, gold, gems, and medicines.
   
   They decide with sound reasoning, abandoning unstable arguments. Therefore, one should determine their own welfare using sound reasoning and faith.
   
   One should strive for its attainment, not relying on unstable arguments. One should not desist from effort and perseverance, unlike the followers of Shunga.
   
   With faith, one dedicated to effort should not be hindered in any way. By relying on firm effort, how can one fail to achieve the desired result?

   Through effort, farmers obtain grain, merchants acquire wealth, kings secure their kingdom's riches, and scholars gain knowledge, the foundation of all happiness.

Laborers obtained wages, gods acquired nectar, ascetics attained the highest world, and others achieved their desired goals through effort indeed.
   
   With unstable reasoning and without faith, what results has anyone ever achieved? Tell me, considering that.
   
   Sometimes, due to failure to achieve results and a lack of assurance everywhere, one should recognize him as afflicted by fate, appearing as his own enemy.
   
   Therefore, relying on effort nourished by faith and sound reasoning, one should adopt that foremost means of achieving welfare.
   
   There is a diversity of means that is observed, and among them, one should achieve that which is attainable in every way, as that is indeed the principal goal.
   
   Deciding through sound reasoning and experience, one should act quickly. I will explain everything to you, so listen attentively.
   
   One should recognize that true welfare is that from which one does not grieve again. Grief is seen everywhere with a subtle vision.
   
   That which is intertwined with griefs is not true welfare in any way: wealth, sons, wives, kingdom, treasury, strength, and fame.
   
   Knowledge, intellect, sight, body, beauty, and wealth�all these are unstable, held within the jaws of the serpent of time.
   
   Situated as the seed of the great power of the sprout of grief, how can it be deserving of suitability for ultimate welfare?
   
   Therefore, the highest welfare primarily lies in this; thus, in the matter of wealth and other material possessions, there is a delusion of desirability.
   
   Arisen from delusion, the great lord is the deluder and the creator of all worlds; therefore, all are deluded.
   
   People here are deluded to some extent due to partial knowledge of some deluder; some are affected, but not all, because that knowledge is limited.
   
   Even those with little knowledge have surpassed the deluder in their delusions; then who is capable of surpassing the great god, the ultimate deluder?
   
   Who in the world, by counter-knowledge, understands the small delusion, emerges from it, remains calm, and attains eternal happiness.
   
   Even such knowledge is not attainable without resorting to the deluder, until one pleases him in every way.
   
   
   Therefore, without pleasing the great deluder, how can one overcome the great delusion? Thus, one should resort to him in every way.
   
   Whoever pleases him properly and attains his grace will certainly achieve transcendence from that delusion through great knowledge.
   
   Other practices mentioned for achieving welfare will not yield results without the grace of the great lord.
   
   Therefore, one should first worship the great lord, the cause of the universe, with devotion, and then quickly undertake practices that destroy delusion.
   
   This world, along with its parts, is directly seen as an effect, beginning with the earth, even with an unseen cause, sufficiently evident.
   
   By reasoning in this way, firmly supported by many scriptures, one should ascertain a doer there, distinct from all other doers.
   
   Although some scriptures claim the world is without a doer, this is well refuted by many scriptures supported by sound reasoning.
   
   Where the purpose is self-destruction, based solely on perception, it is merely the appearance of scripture, not a great authority.
   
   Scripture based solely on dry logic should indeed be rejected. Others also claim that this world is eternal.
   
   If this world is considered to be the work of one without intelligence, it is incongruous, as action is preceded by intelligence, and action is not observed in the absence of intelligence.
   
   Supported by many scriptures, the doer here is indeed intelligent. Action performed by an intelligent doer is certainly observed there.
   
   Thus, through sound reasoning and scripture, it is established that this world has a doer, but that doer is distinct from the worldly doers.
   
   Due to the inconceivable nature of the effect, the doer possesses inconceivable and infinite power and unlimited capability, in accordance with the effect.
   
   He is indeed capable of uplifting those who have surrendered in every way. Therefore, always take refuge in him with all your being.
   
   I will give you an example; listen to the reasoning with belief. Even a limited lord here in the world can be pleased without deceit.
   
   This lord of the world, when properly pleased by someone, provides a person with desired objects for their welfare.
   
   Tell me, what would the one who is uniquely affectionate to devotees not give to them? Indeed, worldly lords are unstable and lack true affection.
   
   Merciless and ungrateful, their results are therefore unstable. The supreme lord, however, is an ocean of compassion, grateful, and well established.
   
   Otherwise, in the beginningless cycle of existence, how could one attain faultlessness? Tell me, how could the world's course be maintained?
   
   Because the kingdoms of the unstable are seen to be lost, he is therefore described as an ocean of compassion and well established.
   
   Quickly take refuge in him with all your being and devotion. He will lead you to welfare; do not succumb to subordination.
   
   Worship comes in various forms, for the distressed and the wealth-seeking, but there is also causeless worship, and that is true worship.
   
   It is observed everywhere that when the distressed worship the lord, he sometimes, overcome with compassion, releases them from their suffering.
   
   Sometimes, he disregards worship due to differences; likewise, for wealth-seekers, the result is limited and uncertain.
   
   Recognizing the sincerity of the causeless worshipper after a long time, even the limited and unstable lord becomes dependent on that devotion.
   
   Due to ignorance, it may take a long time to recognize causelessness. This lord of all is indeed the lord of the hearts of all.
   
   The lord knows everything and quickly grants results to the distressed and the wealth-seeker, engaging them with their desired purpose.
   
   By his own law, waiting for the ripening of actions, the lord determines the result for the causeless worshipper who takes exclusive refuge in him.
   
   Knowing this, the lord becomes the provider of well-being for all beings, without waiting for the ripening of actions, setting aside his own law.
   
   Having accomplished that means, the lord quickly brings about the result; this is indeed true lordship and great independence.
   
   The lord also opposes destined law; this is seen in the case of M?ka??u's son, who was exceedingly devoted to the lord.
   
   It is known by all that Mahe?a can transgress ordained fate. I will explain the reasoning behind this; listen, dear to my heart.
   
   Even though ordained fate is not to be transgressed, for those lacking determination, that fate remains unaltered.
   
   Therefore, through breath control, fate is conquered. It does not impose sufficient suffering on those who are determined; this is observed.
   
   Those who are swallowed by the serpent of fate, lacking determination, indeed experience it as ordained by fate.
   
   Fate is the power of the lord, solely of the nature of his will. The true will of the lord is indeed not to be transgressed.
   
   She becomes hindered when devoted to the supreme lord, yet she also becomes unhindered because of that lord.
   
   Therefore, abandon faulty reasoning and take refuge in Lord Mahe?a. He will causelessly engage you in welfare.
   
   This is indeed the first step to the mansion of welfare. Without taking this step, there is no fruit-bearing elsewhere.
   
   Having heard these words, O R?ma, Hemach??a, with a very pleased mind, asked his dear one again.
   
   Dear, tell me about Mahe?a, who can be my refuge, the creator of all, the independent self, by whose power the world is controlled.
   
   Some call him Vishnu, others call him Shiva, Ganesha, Surya, Narasimha, Buddha, or Sugata.
   
   They have called him Arhant, Vasudeva, Prana, Soma, Pavaka, and described him in many ways as action, the main principle, and atoms.
   
   The form of the world's cause is divided by various beliefs. In this context, where should one place their understanding of the lord?
   
   It is clear that nothing is unknown to you, as the lord Vy?ghrap?da, who has seen both the past and the future, has stated this.
   
   Therefore, you too, women, shine with this knowledge. Tell me, dear one who speaks with nectar-like words, with faithfulness.

   Thus asked, Hemalekha, delighted, said to her dear, "Lord, I will explain. Listen to the decision about the supreme being."
   
   The lord is indeed the creator and dissolver of the universe. He is Vishnu, Shiva, the creator, Surya, and Soma.
   
   He is indeed all-encompassing and designated by many names. He is neither Shiva, Vishnu, nor the creator, nor any other specific form.
   
   I will explain this to you; listen closely. They say that Shiva, the five-faced and three-eyed one, is the creator.
   
   He is the creator, like a conscious potter with a body. Similarly, in the world, a conscious creator with a body is also observed.
   
   A bodiless or unconscious entity is never observed as a doer anywhere. Therefore, true doership is only possible for the conscious.
   
   In dreams, the soul, leaving the gross body, creates all desired things with a body of consciousness.
   
   Therefore, the body is an instrument for the actions of the conscious self. Since living beings depend on instruments, their independence is incomplete.
   
   Indeed, the Lord, the creator of the world, due to His complete independence, creates everything without depending on anything and without any deficiency.
   
   Therefore, the body does not truly exist; this is the main conclusion. Otherwise, like the world, the doer would be dependent on a material cause.
   
   Thus, if the Lord were to create the world through a collection of causes such as place and time, He would indeed become a living being.
   
   Complete sovereignty in the creation of the world as earlier discussed would have to be compromised. The doership of all would be obstructed; there is no doubt.
   
   Therefore, the world is created without depending on a visible body. Thus, the gross body does not exist in reality, my beloved of life.
   
   In the supreme form, the gross-minded are indeed deluded by this bodiless aspect. However, those who are devoted and meditate, regardless of where and how, are not.
   
   Thus, like the wish-fulfilling gem for devotees, the lord takes on many forms. Therefore, the Lord is indeed conscious, and his body must be supreme consciousness.
   
   Consciousness is indeed the great existence, the supreme goddess. Tripura shines as the undivided essence from which this world, though appearing divided, emanates.
   
   This world, both moving and non-moving, is like an illusory city. Its singular form removes any notion of high or low.
   
   Others may imagine primary and secondary forms; therefore, the wise should worship the supreme, indivisible form.
   
   One whose intellect is fixated on the gross form is limited. By worshiping that form without understanding, he may still attain the ultimate good. Otherwise, his path would remain unfulfilled, even across millions of lifetimes.
   
Thus ends the seventh chapter named "Description of the Nature of God" in the Story of Hemachuda in the revered Knowledge Section.


CHAPTER 8: EXPLANATION OF DESCRIPTION OF THE WORLD
   
   Having heard the beloved�s words and grasped the essence of the great lord, Hemachuda understood from Hemalekha's explanation that Tripura is composed of consciousness.
   
   With a calm mind, having learned from the teachers about Tripura, the great goddess endowed with supreme powers, he recognized her supreme qualities.
   
   Single-mindedly devoted to her, Hemachuda worshipped her with unwavering dedication, and thus, several months passed.
   
   The supreme goddess Tripura graced his heart, turning his mind away from worldly objects and leading him into deep contemplation.
   
   Such a mind inclined toward contemplation, which is the principal cause of liberation, is rare in the world without the grace of others.
   
   O Rama, until a deeply contemplative mind arises, the ultimate good cannot be attained by any number of means.
   
   Then, on another day, he was alone with his beloved, with a deeply contemplative mind.
   
   Seeing him approach from a distance, she rose, welcomed him in, and seated him on her seat.
   
   After washing his feet with reverence and worshiping him according to tradition, she spoke supreme words, flowing with the beauty of nectar.
   
   Beloved, today I see you after a long time. Is your body free from illness, or was it troubled by disease?
   
   Please tell me what has happened, as you did not remember me or speak to me during this time.
   
   Not even a part of the day went by like this before. How did this happen? I fear you might be displeased with me and not following the right path.
   
   How did this happen, even in a dream or elsewhere? Tell me, how did you spend a night that once felt like an age?
   
   Without me, even a single moment felt like an age, unbearably long. Saying this, she embraced him and appeared briefly distressed.
   
   He also embraced his beloved and showed no sign of discomfort. He said, "Dear, you should not confuse me like this."
   
   I know you well; there is no reason for sorrow for you. How could delusion touch you, wise one who knows the ultimate truth?
   
   I have come to truly ask you something; listen to what I will say. Tell me clearly about the events you mentioned before.
   
   Who is the mother you mentioned, who is your friend, and who is her husband? Who are her children, and are they yours or mine? Where are they?
   
   I do not know that well, and I don't think it's spoken falsely. However, it seems that you are implying something with what you've said.
   
   Please analyze and explain that to me clearly. I am devoted to you, and I need you to remove the doubt from my heart.
   
   Thus addressed, Hemalekha, with clear eyes and a pure mind, reflected on the divine grace bestowed on him.
   
   Indeed, he is highly detached from sense objects due to his great fortitude, influenced by the power of Lord Mahesha and enriched by the accumulation of merit.
   
   It is time for awakening, and so I will enlighten him. O Lord, your great fortune has indeed come through the grace of the Lord.
   
   Otherwise, disinterest in sense objects is not commonly observed. This trait is recognized from the beginning as the grace of the Lord.
   
   Behold, I will explain to you the conduct stated by the wise, the mind's disinterest in enjoyment and inclination towards contemplation.
   
   The supreme consciousness is my mother; intellect is regarded as my friend, and ignorance, which is her husband, is considered unreal. It is through this ignorance that the intellect is well-associated.
   
   The power of ignorance is evident in the world, as it makes a rope appear like a snake and instills great fear.
   
   The great delusion, the mind, is its offspring and their child, imagination is its spouse, and the sensory organs are its five sons.
   
   The five sensory organs are their domain, and the perception of objects is the impression left on the mind.
   
   That enjoyment of senses is a dreamlike pleasure, like a sister of imagination. His other wife is intense desire, and her two sons are anger and greed.
   
   Anger and greed are considered their city, which is the body. My great mantra is indeed the self-revelation.
   
   Breath is referred to as Pracara and is the close friend of the mind. Forests and similar places are described as hells. Thus, everything is explained.
   
   The union of intellect with me is termed concentration. The attainment of my mother�s world is described as liberation, dear.
   
   Thus, I have shared my own story. Your story is also similar. Understand this clearly through reasoning, attain the supreme welfare.
   
   Thus ends the eighth chapter named "Explanation of the Description of the World" in the revered Knowledge Section in the story of Hemachuda.
   
   
   

CHAPTER 9: HEMACHUDA�S REST
   
   Having heard his beloved�s words, Hemachuda was astonished. With a voice choked with joy, he began to speak again.
   
   Oh dear, you are blessed and skillful. How can I describe the splendor of your knowledge, who has spoken about that as a complete story?
   
   I was unaware of such a story about my nature. Your words have made it as clear to me as a fruit in my hand.
   
   I recall and experience it within the wonderful actions of the world. Who is that supreme consciousness, the mother, and how are we born from her?
   
   "Who are we, and what is our nature? Tell me that," he asked Hemalekha. She then spoke to his beloved.
   
   Listen, my lord, I will respectfully explain this hidden meaning. Contemplate the form of the self with an extremely pure intellect.
   
   It is neither visible nor speakable, so how will I explain? By knowing your own true form, you will indeed come to know the mother.
   
   Indeed, there is no command in one�s true form, hence it is without a commander. Perceive your own form with your self and pure intellect.
   
   Shining from gods to lower beings, illuminated by rays, it shines everywhere, encompassing everything, always without a mind.
   
   How, where, when, and by whom can it be described even partially? Now, It is similar to you asking, �Show me my eyes, beloved�.
   
   Here, a teacher is of no use as in seeing one�s own eyes. Even a skilled great teacher, how can he show you your eyes?
   
   Therefore, the teacher is merely a means to reveal it. I will tell you that method; listen with a restrained mind.
   
   As long as you see "mine" in the self, your true form, which is beyond "mine," will not shine for you.
   
   Seek solitude and discern this: whatever shines as "mine," abandon it. Beyond that, observe the self.
   
   As I appear to you as "mine," it is not because I possess self-ness. It is merely due to our relationship and your own thinking, not because of my true essence.
   
   Abandon everything for my sake, even that which cannot truly be abandoned. Realize the self and attain supreme welfare.
   
   Thus spoken by his beloved, Hemachuda quickly stood, mounted a horse, and left the city at that moment.
   
   Entering the garden resembling Nandan in a moment, he entered a tall crystal mansion at the forest's edge.
   
   Dismissing all attendants and instructing the gatekeepers, he ordered that no one should enter during his solitary contemplation.
   
   The king's ministers, teachers, or the king himself, even if assembled here, are not allowed to enter until I give you the order.
   
   Having spoken thus, he ascended the mansion and entered the ninth floor, where there was a beautiful window with a view of all worlds.
   
   He sat on a soft cushioned seat, free from others, and then, focusing his mind firmly, he engaged in contemplation.
   
   How are all these people so deluded? Not even one among them knows their own self even slightly.
   
   Everyone engages in various activities for their own sake. Some read scriptures and Vedic texts daily.
   
   Some earn wealth, some rule the earth. Others fight with enemies, while some indulge solely in pleasures.
   
   They do all this for self-interest, but what truly is the self? No one here knows this; where, then, does this delusion come from?
   
   Alas, without truly knowing the self, all this has been done. It is like actions performed in vain in a dream. Now, I contemplate this.
   
   House and grain, kingdom and wealth, women and cattle, and other possessions are not my essence; as they exist in the absence of the "I-ness" in them.
   
   For my sake, because of my existence, I should indeed be the body in every way. Surely, I am a Kshatriya heir with a fair body, no doubt.
   
   With "I-ness" overcome about others, and seeing others in the same way, the prince contemplated that body.
   
   Then he began to negate the selfhood of the body. He thought, alas, how can this body be the refuge of possessiveness?
   
   The aggregate of blood, bones, and such, constantly changing, may surely be just my form. He severed (his attachment to the body), and indeed observed.
   
   Like wood or clay established in dreams (which keep changing), similarly, I am not the body; I may indeed be something else. This life-breath is also similar.
   
   I may not be the mind or intellect, since these are mine. Thus, from body to intellect, I am indeed something else, no doubt.
   
   I am never absent, even when there is no appearance of the world. I am always established as existing, no doubt.
   
   Clearly, what is the awareness of my existence? I do not know that; why is this unknown to me?
   
   The pot and similar objects appear through the eyes and other senses, not otherwise on earth. This life-breath is felt through touch; the mind is perceived through knowledge by intellect.
   
   Thus, how is it that I am not aware of my intellect? If the self does not shine, then from where does this awareness of everything come to me?
   
   Then, I will not contemplate the mind and intellect; my awareness will arise. Thus deciding, he abandoned the mental sphere through his mind.
   
   Then, for a moment, he saw dense darkness. Determining in his mind that this is the form of his self.
   
   He experienced incomparable joy by doing this and then thought, "Surely, I will see again." With this in mind, he restrained his thoughts once more.
   
   Through forceful practice, he restrained his restless mind and clearly saw a mass of light, without beginning or end, shining for a moment.
   
   Awakened, he thought, "What is this?" Amazed, he said, "Oh, I see various forms. What is this self, and how does this happen?"
   
   Then, he restrained his mind once more, saying, "I will see again." His mind, absorbed in sleep, remained steady for a long time.
   
   There, he saw a network of dreams, filled with various strange visions. Then, greatly awakened, he attained profound thought.
   
   What dreams did I see while covered by sleep? I saw both darkness and light; perhaps the self has a dream-like nature.
   
   The dream is indeed a mental delight; how can I abandon it? So, firmly resolving, I will restrain my mind and see again.
   
   He restrained his mind forcefully until it became steady. Then, he felt as if he were immersed in an ocean of inner bliss.
   
   With the movement of his mind, he immediately awakened. What was that? Was it a dream or just mental confusion?
   
   Or is this indeed the truth? It seems inconceivable to me. I have never experienced such bliss before; how did I attain it?
   
   Oh, nothing here in this world, compares to even a fragment of this bliss. I was deluded, as if in deep sleep; how did this bliss still remain?
   
   I do not perceive any cause here; how can that be? Despite my efforts for self-realization, I did not know this until today.
   
   I see the self, as another, and yet another; what can this be? Is it light or darkness, bliss or something else?
   
   This self may be mine, and this form seems to follow sequentially. I cannot reach a final conclusion here; I will ask my wise, dear one again.
   
   Thus deciding, the prince called the doorkeeper and instructed him to bring Hemalekha to his presence.
   
   She arrived promptly at the doorkeeper's order and ascended the great mansion that looked like moonlight gracing Mount Meru.
   
   Then she saw the prince, her dear one, with a tranquil mind, steady, unchanging, and with senses withdrawn.
   
   Approaching near, she quickly ascended her seat, and she sat beside him in a moment.
   
   Opening his eyes, he saw her present by his side. Seeing his dear one, he quickly embraced her with affection.
   
   Then his dear one spoke beautiful, nectar-like words, "My lord, why have you called me? Is your body healthy?"
   
   Tell me the reason you called me, for which I have come. Thus asked by his dear one, he spoke to her about his experiences.
   
   Dear, as you instructed, I have settled here in solitude, deeply contemplating the nature and characteristics of the self.
   
   Furthermore, it is strange that it is observed as separate; why is that? The self is always present and manifest.
   
   Incorrect perception arises from other perceptions. Considering this, I stopped those other perceptions and became well-settled.
   
   I saw darkness and other time light, sometimes experiencing great bliss. What is this? Tell me, dear.
   
   Is this truly the form of the self, or could it be something else? Properly discern it and tell me how I can observe it.
   
   Thus addressed, Hemalekha, the knower of the ultimate, said: "Listen, dear, I will tell you everything with a concentrated mind."
   
   The effort you made in external suppression is auspicious, approved by all, especially by those who know the self.
   
   Without that, no one has attained it anywhere or anytime. However, it does not become a cause since it is always present.
   
   If the self is not attained, selfhood cannot exist; and if selfhood exists, how can there be non-attainment? The self is unattainable by any means, as it is always present; thus, the concept of attaining it does not apply.
   
   For what is unattained, there can be attainment, but not for the self. Therefore, its suppression is not for the purpose of attainment. Here, consider an example.
   
   Something covered by darkness is revealed when illuminated by lamps, as if it were newly attained. It is just like that.
   
   Just as someone with a confused mind, having forgotten an ornament somewhere, suppresses other thoughts and, with concentration, recalls it again.
   
   Just as one recovers a lost ornament, it is as if it were newly found. Suppression is not the cause of its recovery; rather, it is the means to rediscover the ornament as it truly is.
   
   Similarly, in attaining the self, the suppression of external objects is not the cause. You have not yet perceived the self because of a lack of comprehension.
   
   Just as an unlearned person, entering the royal assembly at night, sees the courtiers and lamps but does not recognize the real source of the illumination (the self).
   
   Listen, dear, when suppression ends, darkness is seen. At the beginning of seeing this darkness, your true state is established.
   
   Contemplate that state always, as it provides supreme bliss. Here in this world, all are ensnared by the great delusion of outward perception.
   
   Searching and searching, they were obstructed and did not attain that state. In the world, there are scholars, skilled and excellent logicians.
   
   Not knowing that state, they grieve day and night. That state cannot be attained by mere word-craft.
   
   As long as a learned person searches or contemplates, it remains unattainable because it cannot be grasped.
   
   Having gone far, it is unattainable, but by remaining still, it is always present. It cannot be known through contemplation; it shines without contemplation.
   
   Chasing it is like trying to catch one's shadow on the head; it cannot be attained through action anywhere. Just as in a clean mirror, thousands of reflections are seen (so is this world).
   
   Just as a child sees reflections but does not see the mirror; likewise, a person sees the reflection of the world in the great mirror of the self.
   
   One does not know the self due to a lack of understanding, just as someone familiar with the sky sees it but does not fully realize what it is.
   
   The world does not realize the sky; similarly, it does not comprehend the nature of the self. Lord, with subtle vision, see the world as composed of the nature of knowledge and the known.
   
   Knowledge is self-established; in its absence, nothing exists. It is the measure of all means of knowledge and stands on its own.
   
   Since it is independent of means of knowledge and self-established from the beginning, it is not attained by the means of attainment.
   
   For the confused, there is neither question nor answer. That great mirror cannot be denied.
   
   There, everything shines like a reflection in a mirror. There are no limitations of space or time.
   
   Since it shines from within, how can there be limitations of space or time? The appearance of such limitations is like objects appearing in the sky (for the sky is unaffected by them).
   
   Prince, with subtle vision, observe your own self in which this world shines within the universal consciousness.
   
   Through perfect absorption in that, one attains complete doership. I will explain the realization through which you can achieve that state.
   
   Observe with subtle intellect the state between sleep and waking, between different states of consciousness, and between consciousness and the known (the world).
   
   This state is one's own true form, and upon attaining it, one is no longer deluded. The world continues in its confusion due to ignorance of this truth.
   
   Here, there is no form, taste, smell, touch, or sound. There is no sorrow or happiness, nothing to be grasped, and no one to grasp.
   
   This is the supreme lord, supporting all, embodying all forms yet devoid of all, the sustainer � Vishnu, Ishvara, and Sadashiva.
   
   See, restraining slightly within the self by the self, giving up external expansion, striving for inner expansion.
   
   Let go of the thought "I see", and, like a blind person with a steady mind, relinquish seeing and not seeing. Quickly realize who you are.
   
   Thus spoken by his beloved, Hemachuda, having realized that state, attained deep rest, and forgot the outward world.
   
   Thus ends the ninth chapter named "Hemachuda's Rest" in the revered Knowledge Section of Tripura Rahasya.
   
   
   

CHAPTER 10: CONCLUSION OF HEMACHUDA�S STORY
   
   Then Hemalekha saw that her beloved, having attained the supreme state, remained unmoved from it even for a moment.
   
   Awakened, he opened his eyes and saw the beloved world, but desiring to return to that state of rest with great urgency.
   
   As he closed his eyes, she took his hand and spoke sweetly to him.
   
   Lord, what was your intention? Tell me what happened to you when you closed or opened your eyes. Reflect on your gain or loss.
   
   When you open your eyes, what is not attained? And what is attained by closing them? Beloved, tell me; I wish to understand your state.
   
   Thus asked by her, he spoke as if intoxicated, lazy, and reluctant, weighed down by his laziness.
   
   Beloved, I have attained the deepest rest after a long time. There is no rest for me in the external world, which is full of sorrow.
   
   Enough of external efforts and contemplations. Blinded by misfortune, I did not recognize the true happiness of the self until now.
   
   Just as someone wandering for alms not knowing their own home, I did not recognize the ocean of my own happiness, again and again.
   
   Thinking that sensory pleasure to be superior, though it is overwhelmed by a flood of sorrows and is as fleeting as lightning, I sought stability due to my attachment to it.
   
   Afflicted by sorrows, I did not find rest. Alas, people lack the discernment between sorrow and happiness.
   
   Seekers of happiness often foolishly amass a collection of sorrows. I have had enough of this self-inflicted suffering.
   
   Beloved, please have mercy on me. With folded hands, I request a long rest in my own blissful self.
   
   Alas, though you know this state, it seems you are struck by fate. Despite knowing it, you foolishly continue to seek sorrow.
   
   Thus spoken, she, slightly smiling, spoke to her beloved, "Lord, that supremely pure state is not known to you."
   
   That state, where the wise and pure-hearted are not deluded, remains distant for you, like the sky is for one on the ground.
   
   You may know something, but not that state. That state is not seen by the closing or opening of your eyes.
   
   It is never attained through action or inaction. Without moving or moving, one cannot reach that state.
   
   How can the complete state be attained through closing, doing, or going, measured by the blink of an eyelash?
   
   If it were hidden within, the state would always be full. Oh, the grandeur of your delusion is truly astonishing � what more can I say?
   
   In which countless universes, positioned at different angles, is hidden within the width of an eyelash's opening?
   
   Listen, prince, I will reveal the essence of truth: until all the knots are broken, true happiness is not attained.
   
   There are countless knots formed into ropes of delusion. The lack of self-awareness is described as this rope of delusion.
   
   Wherever there are knots of distorted understanding, the initial certainty about the self is found in the inquiry into one�s own body. (This is jiva)
   
   This world, which spreads out and is hard to resist, is under the influence of someone. In the world, the belief in the non-self is based on perception. (This is ishvara)
   
   Thus, the beliefs that create a sense of separation between the individual soul (jiva) and the divine (Ishvara) are considered knots. These misconceptions have existed for a long time and are continuously being reformed.
   
   A person bound by these knots is in bondage. Liberation from this bondage is achieved by loosening these knots.
   
   When you close your eyes and fully realize your state, you attain your own true form, which is pure and supreme consciousness.
   
   That is the great mirror reflecting the entire world. Tell me, when, where, and in what form is it not so? Explain.
   
   When someone says that your consciousness has a specific form, it is as limited as a son of a barren woman � impossible and without basis in time and space.
   
   Just as a reflection cannot exist without a mirror, so, O Lord, without that state, there is nothing anywhere.
   
   By opening your eyes, what would it conceal? As long as you think this way, the knot remains tightly bound.
   
   As long as that state is not attained, what you achieve is not that. Whether you close or open your eyes, what you believe you�ve attained is not that state.
   
   Therefore, that which is complete and undivided is always present, even when limited by actions. Where, O Lord, is that protector not found, like the brilliant light of the eternal flame?
   
   It reveals one's own self with profound insight, much like the buildup of fuel. Once you understand the supreme state, no further duties remain for you.
   
   Abandon the knot of "I see," which is rooted in the heart. �
Uproot the deep, firm knot of "This is not I"
   
   See the self everywhere, filled with unbroken bliss. Observe the entire world within the self, just as a reflection appears in a mirror.
   
   Without further contemplation, turn inward and see the entire self present everywhere. Then, find peace in being with your own self.
   
   Hearing the words of his beloved, Hemachuda, with a pure heart, recognized his complete self everywhere and thus was freed from delusion.
   
   Gradually, by achieving deep immersion and steady contemplation, he remained constantly absorbed, spending his time with Hemalekha and groups of young women.
   
   Ruling his prosperous kingdom, conquering enemies in battle, imparting scriptures to others, listening to them, and accumulating wealth.
   
   By performing Ashvamedha, Rajasuya, and other major sacrifices, he remained on earth for twenty thousand years as a liberated soul.
   
   Seeing his son established in the state of liberation while still living, the king, along with Muktachuda and his brother Manichuda, also reflected on this.
   
   Why does he not appear here as before, neither excessively rejoicing in happiness nor disturbed by sorrow?
   
   Why does he view gain and loss, enemy and friend with equanimity, performing his royal duties as if merely acting on a stage?
   
   He always seems intoxicated, like someone drinking an intoxicating beverage, with his mind elsewhere, yet he performs his duties adequately, as if detached.
   
   For what reason, and approaching him privately, they asked Hemachuda, "Why are you like this?"
   
   Hemachuda then gradually explained his state to them, enlightening both his brother and father.
   
   Having attained the supreme truth, they became liberated while living. Hearing this, the ministers also understood the nature of the world.
   
   Considering the nature of their own selves, they became knowers of the knowable. Thus, in the city of Vishala, they gradually and mutually understood this.
   
   From the teachings, everyone came to understand the truth, including children, cowherds, men, women, the young and old, as well as male and female servants.
   
   Having realized the ultimate truth and abandoned identification with the body, they became free from desire, anger, and greed.
   
   Whether a child or an elder, if one is not truly knowledgeable, they often display traits like anger and desire, remaining engaged in worldly affairs.
   
   The mother plays with the child while discussing the supreme truth. Both male and female servants consistently serve their master in the same manner.
   
   While discussing the supreme truth with words, actors perform dramas with characters embodying that truth.
   
   Singers deliver songs centered on the wisdom of discernment, while jesters consistently critique worldly affairs.
   
   Scholars teach scriptures to students, providing examples that aid in understanding the supreme truth.
   
   Thus, in that place, men and women, male and female servants, actors, jesters, attendants, soldiers, ministers, artisans, and courtesans.
   
   All of them became knowers of the knowable in the city of Vishala, while continuing their worldly affairs, influenced by the strength of their previous impressions.
   
   They neither remember the past, whether good or bad, nor contemplate the future as causes of joy or sorrow.
   
   Situated in the present, a person, like one intoxicated with honey, smiles, rejoices, grieves, and gets angry, remaining deeply engaged in worldly affairs.
   
   Such was that city which sages like Sanaka called the famous city of knowledge upon arriving.
   
   Where even caged parrots continuously repeat, "Worship your own self in the form of consciousness."
   
   There is nothing known apart from consciousness, just like a reflection in a mirror. Consciousness is the only thing that is known; I am consciousness, and everything, both moving and stationary, is consciousness.
   
   Since everything shines because of consciousness, which is independent, people, revere consciousness as it illuminates and supports all.
   
   Worship pure consciousness with clear vision, abandoning illusion. Even animals in such a place speak these words.
   
   Even today, that place is known as the famous city of knowledge. There, Hemalekha once provided enlightenment.
   
   Hemachuda attained wisdom and liberation while still alive, and others, including women, children, and various individuals, all came to understand both the highest and lowest truths.
   
   Therefore, the source of true well-being is association with the wise. To achieve well-being, one should first seek refuge with the wise.
   
   Thus ends the tenth chapter named "Conclusion of Hemachuda's Story" in the revered Knowledge Section of Tripura Rahasya.
   
   

CHAPTER 11: EXPLANATION OF THE ESSENCE OF THE WORLD
   
   After hearing the remarkable story of Hemachuda, Bhargava, with a questioning mind, began to inquire.
   
   O revered teacher, the knowledge you have shared is indeed marvelous, but it seems to me difficult and unattainable in every respect.
   
   How can this visible world be of the nature of pure consciousness? It is not apparent, and indeed, this can only be accepted through faith, not otherwise.
   
   Consciousness, being free from objects, cannot be perceived in any way. This seems unfeasible. How can the mind even reach this understanding?
   
   With kindness, I wish to be fully enlightened on this matter. Thus asked, Guru Dattatreya responded to Bhargava.
   
   Listen, O Rama, I will explain the nature of the visible world as it truly is. The visible world is entirely pure consciousness and nothing else.
   
   Here, I will explain the reasoning. Listen attentively and with focus. This visible world is the effect, perceptible from its cause.
   
   Creation appears anew each moment. The world continuously shines with freshness, emerging afresh every instant.
   
   Some say this world arises in a single moment, while others view it as an aggregate of elements, consisting of both moving and unmoving components.
   
   It is established that the world arises in every possible way. Therefore, the theory of nature is deemed inappropriate due to its excessive implications.
   
   Given the consistency and contradiction in determining cause and effect, and the coherence of activities, how can it be considered accidental?
   
   Sometimes, even if the cause is not visible, an unseen cause should be assumed. This is justifiable, as universally acknowledged.
   
   Repeatedly, when an effect is observed with a cause, it should be assumed to have a cause even if it is not seen; otherwise, it would contradict universal experience.
   
   Activity would be contradicted; therefore, everything must have a cause. Thus, every effect must have a cause.
   
   Since the world is seen everywhere, nothing exists without a cause. Some argue that effects are produced by unreal atoms.
   
   For such people, the world would seem extremely different, even completely non-existent. The unity of non-existence and existence is inherently contradictory and cannot be.
   
   Indeed, being both drunk and not drunk, or light and darkness simultaneously, cannot be reconciled due to inherent contradictions and resulting confusion.
   
   Even with the will of the Lord, how could the origin of the first action arise? That is impossible for the world, which is characterized by a balance of qualities, to come into being.
   
   This world appears because it arises from inequality and deficiency in the cause of equality, driven by baseless intelligence and a lack of evidence.
   
   Therefore, the cause of the world's activity is not perceived. The unseen is supported by scripture, not by other considerations.
   
   Due to the limitations of the perceivers and the instability of the means of knowledge, the separation of the effect from the doer is often observed.
   
   This world, having a doer, suggests that the doer is conscious. How can a doer of such an unimaginable nature be considered ordinary?
   
   Therefore, he possesses unimaginable power, and scripture reflects this. The means of knowledge that reveals the complete truth is indeed uninterrupted and superior in every respect.
   
   There, indeed, is one Lord Shiva is described in the past as independent and without a material cause, due to the grandeur of his independence.
   
   The diverse and fascinating world appears as if it is illuminated by the light of one�s own inner self, just like how a dream world is created by the mind itself.
   
   The body is accepted as real only due to the sense of �I� (ahamkara), and similarly, this world is perceived. The world is not different from the body, as the difference arises from the same cause as in dreams.
   
   Just as the physical body of the world does not dissolve with changes or dissolution, you, as pure consciousness, remain unaffected by these changes. You are distinct from the body and other forms.
   
   Therefore, the deity, embodying the singular essence of emptiness and consciousness, reveals the entire world within oneself, remaining unchanged and constant.
   
   Where else could the world be revealed if not within oneself? Is it possible for anyone else to reveal it? Only consciousness can exist at all times.
   
   Wherever consciousness is said to be absent, that place itself does not exist. Since nothing can prove the absence of consciousness, it is clear that consciousness is supreme.
   
   The great existence, which encompasses the world completely, appears like waves without an ocean or light without the sun.
   
   Since the world cannot exist without consciousness, this great deity, Mahadeva must be in the form of pure consciousness.
   
   Before creation, the world originated from him, it is sustained by him, and in the end, it dissolves back into him � this world of both moving and non-moving things.
   
   Thus, the well-known teachings of scripture are not contradicted. In matters that are not visible, agreement with scripture serves as evidence.
   
   Because the effects of jewels, mantras, and similar things are visible everywhere, a person with limited understanding may not grasp the full significance of their power.
   
   Therefore, the scripture, which is spoken by the omniscient and all-seeing, describes the deity as being present at the beginning of creation.
   
   Without a material cause, he created the entire world at the beginning, because the great deity possesses complete and pure independence.
   
   The entire world is revealed on the foundation of consciousness. This world does not exist anywhere outside of it.
   
   Because of the lord's completeness, there is no other place in this world. Anything claimed to exist elsewhere is not supported by any evidence.
   
   Similarly, just as a reflection appears on the surface of a mirror, the world is revealed within the deity, making everything consistent.
   
   At the beginning of the world, the actions of the deity are akin to those of a yogi, and creation is regarded as resembling a city imagined by the deity.
   
   O Rama, your mental creation is entirely mind-made, full of various measures and things that can be measured, and it indeed appears as such.
   
   Although differentiated into many forms, nothing exists apart from the mind; whatever arises from the mind remains within it and ultimately merges back into it.
   
   Just as everything is purely mental creation, similarly this world is originating from Shiva, He, Shiva is pure consciousness � formless consciousness itself.
   
   Endowed with the unity of the infinite powers of Tripura and witnessing everything, that consciousness is wholly complete and undivided.
   
   In this world, time and space are perceived as causing division; space is composed of shapes, while time is composed of actions.
   
   Tell me, how could form or action, which are based on that consciousness, cause divisibility?
   
   Tell me, where in space and time does consciousness not exist here? How could anything be where there is no consciousness?
   
   The existence of objects is not a separate form of illumination. Illumination is identified with consciousness, not with non-consciousness.
   
   However, supreme illumination is that which illuminates independently. The insentient objects do not illuminate themselves; they are illuminated by consciousness.
   
   Consciousness illuminates on its own, without depending on anything else. Insentient objects are illuminated by consciousness, not by their own nature.
   
   Listen, if objects exist even in the absence of illumination, then the concepts of existing and not existing would not make sense in this world.
   
   Therefore, the existence of objects in the world is the illumination of consciousness, and nothing else. It is similar to how reflections exist only in the mirror.
   
   Thus, consciousness is the essence of the world; therefore, everything becomes consciousness. Whatever shines represents purity, not impurity.
   
   The clarity of a reflection depends on the hardness and purity of the reflecting surface, resulting in either a clear or unclear image (Similarly, the world is reflected due to the purity in consciousness).
   
   This is clearly observed in mirrors and water as well; due to their insentience, they lack independence.
   
   The dependence of reflections is due to consciousness's pure independence and lack of dependence. Purity is inherently established in consciousness, arising from the absence of impurity.
   
   Diverse qualities seen lead to impurity, but consciousness itself is not diverse. It stems from the nature of unity, the power of consciousness, and its indivisibility in all aspects.
   
   From the nature of the non-empty self, purity in the self is superior in all respects. The appearance of the non-self is simply the result of its illumination through its connection to others.
   
   Those who understand the nature of reflections recognize that the world is like a reflection; it is observed by all.
   
   By itself, it does not shine anywhere, but it shines through the support of consciousness. Therefore, the world is like a well-defined reflection in a mirror.
   
   Even when colored by various states (varied reflections), consciousness illuminates without deviating from its true nature, just like a mirror.
   
   Just as reflections in a mirror are not separate from the mirror itself, similarly reflections in the consciousness are not separate from consciousness.
   
   The reflection in the mirror clearly causes the image we see. Similarly, consciousness can be seen as the source of the world's existence and independence, just as the reflection depends on the mirror.
   
   O Rama, observe how all states are reflected in oneself by one's own will, appearing without any inherent cause or original image.
   
   Will is considered a manifestation of consciousness's independence. In the state without will, consciousness is in its pure, singular form.
   
   Thus, from the pure, singular form of consciousness, there was great independence before creation, which was indeed of the nature of will.
   
   From that, the world manifests like a reflection. Due to the stability of great will, it shines for a long time.
   
   The ordinary world shines because of its complete independence. For others, it appears unusual or complex due to their own lack of completeness (For the jiva, the world appears complex, due to their own imperfections).
   
   Through repeated practice with jewels, mantras, and other methods, and by overcoming personal constraints, one achieves illumination.
   
   Look, O Rama, at the magician who, by will alone and without using any materials, illuminates the entire world-picture everywhere.
   
   The stable, ordinary world, which serves one's purposes, is later on, again withdrawn into oneself. Thus, the world shines.
   
   The yogis clearly perceive creation as fully stable and enveloped in stability, while others see external creation through their own limitations.
   
   Due to its boundless nature, creation exists only within the Lord of Consciousness. Therefore, because it is distinct from the nature of consciousness, it is considered false.
   
   Just as a reflection in a mirror cannot exist without the mirror itself, the world is considered false through contemplation and cannot exist otherwise.
   
   Truth always remains true and doesn�t give up its true nature. In contrast, observe, O descendant of Bhrigu, that the world is naturally unstable and constantly changing.
   
   Truth and falsehood manifest everywhere through division, much like reflections in a mirror. Reflect on this carefully.
   
   The mirror itself is immovable, but the reflection it shows moves. Similarly, while the world is in constant motion, consciousness remains immovable and all-encompassing.
   
   Therefore, the nature of the states depends on the one who perceives them, much like how sunlight illuminates objects.
   
   Just as, for owls and similar creatures that are active at night but blind during the day, they cannot clearly distinguish between light and darkness, as it appears similar to them.
   
   Thus, poison may be harmful to some and not to others. For humans and similar beings, nature is often seen with fear and can be harmful.
   
   But for yogis and celestial beings, nature is not harmful. Time and place, which seem lengthy to humans and similar beings, are experienced differently by them as well.
   
   For gods and yogis, the experience (of time and place) is quite different, just as the apparent distance in a mirror differs from the actual distance.
   
   Similarly, its nature is not stable upon examination. Therefore, nothing exists without some form of support.
   
   What truly exists and shines is only consciousness, the great goddess. Thus, the world is rightly said to be of the nature of that one consciousness.
   
   Thus ends the eleventh chapter named "Explanation of the Essence of the World" in the revered Knowledge Section of Tripura Rahasya.
