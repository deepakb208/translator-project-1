Chapter 1


Om, salutations to the one who is the cause of bliss, the supreme consciousness, who shines in the universe like a mirror.


O Narada, have you heard with an attentive mind, the greatness of the one named Tripura, which the scripture declares as the supreme means?


Today I will tell you great and wonderful knowledge, which upon hearing, a human being will never experience grief again.


Considering thoroughly the Vedic, Vaishnava, Shaiva, Shakta, and Pashupata knowledge, this conclusion has been reached.


Nothing else like this knowledge should occupy the mind. This was established to Bhargava by the Guru Środatta.


Accompanied by reasons and realizations, much adorned, even by what is said here, one cannot know if the mind is bewildered.


He is simply struck by fate, like an immovable post, without a doubt. He does not have any knowledge, even if it is directly defined by Shiva.


Listen, I will explain it to you as it stands in the form of knowledge. Indeed, the conduct of the virtuous is wonderfully remarkable and full of superior qualities.


Even this divine sage desires to hear something from me, though he is indifferent. This benevolence is naturally born among the good.


Just as the natural attraction of the deer towards the scent of musk is inherent, similarly, upon hearing from Dattatreya's mouth the grandeur of his greatness...


Rama, the delight of all people, the son of Jamadagni, of good intent, with his heart captivated by devotion, became somewhat silent.


Then, having expressed his state of mind, his eyes filled with joy, his body thrilled, full, and his inner self filled with bliss.


Joy arising, as if emerging by piercing his hair follicles, he bowed to Guru Dattatreya like a stick near his feet.


Rising, filled with joy, he spoke with a choked sweet voice, "I am blessed, I am accomplished, O revered Guru, by your grace."


My Guru, directly Shiva, an ocean of compassion, is pleased. When he is pleased, even the position of Brahma would be like grass.


Even death attains self-realization from the pleased Guru. Indeed, without any reason, my Guru Maheshvara is pleased today.


I believe that I have attained everything indeed by the grace of the Guru. O master, I have now heard the entire greatness by your grace.


I wish to worship Tripura, the supreme goddess. O Guru, kindly tell me the method of that worship.


Thus requested, Guru Dattatreya, seeing Bhargava's fitness, enhanced by true faith and devotion, for the worship of Tripura.


Gradually, he initiated him for the worship of Tripura. The son of Jamadagni, having received the auspicious initiation of Tripura.


Surpassing all initiations, with the complete awakening of the truth, accompanied by mantra and yantra practices, the entire process.


Having received nectar from the lotus-like face of the revered Guru, like a bee, satisfied in his inner self, Bhargava then filled with bliss.


Permitted by the revered Guru, prepared for the worship of Tripura, having circumambulated the Guru and bowing, he went to Mahendra mountain.


There, creating an auspicious and very blissful residence, he became devoted to worship for twelve years.


Devoted to daily and occasional duties, always dedicated to worship and chanting, exclusively devoted to the meditation of Tripureshanya.


Thus, his twelve years passed like a moment. Then, once comfortably seated, the son of Jamadagni thought.


Previously, what Samvarta said, earnestly requested by me on the path, that indeed was not known by me even in part.


Forgotten by me, therefore, I previously asked the Guru about the greatness of Tripura Shakti, which I heard from the mouth of the revered Guru.


However, what Samvarta had said earlier, I did not understand at all. I had asked the Guru something about the topic of creation.


Then, narrating the story of the battle, the Guru did not say to me, out of context, that which remained.


I do not even know the slightest bit about the movement of this world. Why has this vast spectacle of the universe arisen?


Where does it go again? Where does it attain a stable position? But I see everything unstable everywhere.


Conduct generally stable, why is this also such? I see strange worldly behavior without reflection.


Oh, as the blind followed by the blind indeed act in that manner, the behavior of the world is observed to be the same for all.


Indeed, my self-action here would be an example in all ways. Surely, what happened in my childhood, that I do not remember.


In boyhood, behavior was different, and in youth also different, now, indeed, my activity is different in all ways.


I do not know at all what has become of their actions, in any way whatsoever, in whatever way, at whatever time, and by whomever they are done.


Having understood it rightly, with prior consideration of the consequences, what outcome has been attained there? By whom has happiness been achieved for the self?


Whatever action in this world is examined as having consequences like fruit, that examination indeed is the fruit. I do not consider that examination as the fruit, when that action is done again by the same person.


When the result is attained, how does one desire another result again, tell me. Because all people always act with a desire for the result.


It is indeed that result which has been mentioned: the alleviation of suffering or happiness. In the distinction of duties, there is neither the cessation of suffering nor merely happiness alone.


Duty itself is said to be the supreme sorrow of sorrows. But in its existence, how are you to have the absence of sorrow or happiness?


Just as applying a bandage to the entire body of one burned all over is described here as the gain of happiness from the performance of one’s duty.


Just as the embrace of groups of apsaras for a person whose heart is pierced by arrows, thus is the gain of happiness here said from the performance of one’s duty.


Just as the hearing of a song for a person afflicted by the disease of consumption of poison, thus is the gain of happiness here said from the performance of one’s duty.


Happy indeed are those in the worlds who are without duty, dwelling under trees, the great souls, whose all bodies are very cool.


If someone somewhere could find happiness in the performance of one’s duty, then even a man with a spear wound could find happiness in fragrant garlands.


Oh, what a great wonder this is! Filled with hundreds of duties, there is happiness here, for which a person always acts.


Oh, the greatness of contemplation, what can I say of men, who have overcome mountains of endless duties, and attain happiness.


Just as a sovereign always strives for happiness, so does one engaged in begging for alms always strive.


Separately, they attain happiness, considering accomplishment, all go to achieve the same, and I also follow like them.


Just as a blind person follows another blind person without considering the consequences, similarly, the ignorant person, by not reflecting, repeatedly goes to the ocean of compassion (to seek forgiveness due to their actions).


Desiring to know what is worth knowing, beyond the ocean of doubt, I will reach the other shore, taking refuge in the auspicious boat of the Guru's words.


Thus deciding immediately, the son of Jamadagni, of good intent, set out from that great mountain with the desire to see the Guru.


Reaching the Gandhamadana mountain, he quickly saw the Guru, seated in lotus position, shining like the sun, situated there.


He bowed before the footstool, like a stick on the ground, touched the lotus feet with his head and hands.


So, having bowed down in this way, Rama, Dattatreya, with a pleased mind, blessed him, and graciously raised him up.


"My dear, rise, after a long time, today I see you arrived. Tell me your own state, the events, situated without any illness."


Then, rising by the Guru's words, he, delighted by the Guru's instruction, sat with a joyful heart, and said with folded hands.


Revered Guru, ocean of compassion, immersed in your nectar of grace, how would he be affected by fate-created diseases?


Being situated within the circle of the nectar of your grace, how would a scorching, very frightening disease afflict me?


Internally and externally, by your grace, always delighted, yet situated without separation from your lotus feet.


I am not interested in anything else, even a little bit, seated as I am. Therefore, may I have the sight of your lotus feet again today.


Completeness attained in every way, revered Guru, indeed. Yet, there’s something, unsettling in my heart for a long time.


I wish to ask you that, a long-standing doubt within, permitted by you today, I ask the question.


Hearing thus the words of Bhargava, Dattatreya, an ocean of compassion, delighted, then said to Rama with affection.


Ask, Bhargava, what you have to ask today, long accumulated. Pleased by your devotion, I will tell what you desire.
Chapter 2


Thus instructed, the son of Jamadagni, having bowed to the sage, son of Atri, with humility, bent and began to ask.


O Lord, revered Guru, noble one, all-knowing, ocean of compassion! In the past, anger arose in me due to the lineage of my ancestors.


In addition, deeply embedded within, lies the warrior's lineage, concealed like an embryo in the womb. Indeed, twenty-one times has my heart been filled with the burden of warriors.


The groups of ancestors, satisfied and pleased by the respect of my devotion, calmed my anger. Even though I was initially commanded by the ancestors.


Now, in Ayodhya, dwells Shri Rama, Hari himself. Blinded by anger, I was again overcome by power and pride against him and was led astray.


By him, expelled from pride and defeated by the Lord, I somehow escaped alive by the compassion of the Supreme Brahman.


Then, profound dejection overwhelmed me. Then, I wandered extensively on the path, I lamented many times.


I suddenly met Samvarta, the leader of ascetics, on the path. Covered with ashes, like hidden fire, somehow I recognized him then.


Like heated mist, he was cool all over. Upon meeting him, indeed, I attained a very cool state then.


By me, asked about his state, he spoke sweetly as nectar. He drew out everything, like extracting essence from a stalk, and imparted it all to me.


I was not capable to touch that, like a beggar touching a queen. Entreating again, he then directed me to you.


Then, your pair of feet was reached by me, like a blind man finding company of people, extremely blissful.


That which the sage Samvarta said is not known to me. I heard the complete greatness, which creates devotion to Tripura.


She, the goddess in your form, is always established in my heart. Thus, what result is attained by my existence?


O Lord, kindly tell what Samvarta previously said. Without knowing that, there is no fulfillment anywhere.


Without knowing what was said, whatever is done by me appears futile, like a child's play.


Previously, indeed, many times by sacrifices with profuse gifts and abundant food, the gods led by Indra were worshipped by me.


That fruit indeed is small result, it is heard from the mouth of Samvarta, I consider that small, which is indeed sorrow in every way.


Without happiness, indeed, sorrow would be greater. Little sorrow is considered happiness, because in the absence of happiness, sorrow would be heavier indeed.


Not only this much, indeed, more than this is the glory, the embrace of death, there never will be anything worse than that.


Thus, indeed, whatever is done by me in the worship of Tripura appears to me like child's play, because everything is in the mind.


This, what is said by you to do, should be done accordingly, otherwise, it would be different. Depending on the difference of words, the duty might be different


Different supports and diverse practices are perceived accordingly. How is this comparable to a ritual that yields true fruit?


Since it is based on an untrue self, how can it become like the truth? Nevertheless, one must always perform their duties; there is no limit for them at any time.


Observed by me, the divine Samvarta, entirely cool, free from the poison fire of the trace of duty.


Smiling, as if in the world system, he has taken refuge in the fearless path, in the forest mixed with a forest fire, he was like an elephant residing in cold water.


Delighted by the taste of the nectar of the lack of all duties, how did he attain this state, which he had said to me.


With kindness, O Guru, you should speak all this to me. Liberate me, swallowed by the serpent of duty and time.


Thus, having said, holding the feet with his head, he bowed like a stick. Then, seeing Bhargava in that state, worthy of liberation.


With a compassionate nature, then, Dattatreya began to speak. "My dear Bhargava, you are blessed whose intellect is such."


Like the arrival of a boat to one drowning in the ocean, this, indeed, is the association attained by virtuous actions.


Ascends oneself to the supreme pure state. She, the goddess Tripura, of the form of space in all hearts.


Without any other refuge, the devotee, devoted towards this form, is quickly transformed within the heart, and would be liberated from the net of death.


As long as a man does not firmly fear the ghosts of duties, till then he does not attain happiness, always like one possessed.


Of men bitten by the serpent of duty and time, how is there auspiciousness? Like bodies scorched by the terrible poison flames.


See, indeed, the world, unconscious by the association of the poison of duty, blinded, does not know the action beneficial to itself.


Otherwise, acts again, falls into delusion again. Indeed, this world is such, unconscious by the poison of duty.


From time immemorial, cooked in the terrible ocean of poison, just as some travelers reached the great Vindhya mountain.


Overwhelmed by the burden of hunger, they saw fruits in the forest, quickly desiring fruits, they ate the poisonous berries of Tinduka.


They ate, extremely destroyed by hunger, their senses lost taste, then they were greatly distressed, their bodies burned by the poison flames.


Blinded and searching to calm that poison heat, from consuming the Tinduka fruit, not knowing that it is a poisonous fruit


Thinking of the flame in their own body, they took the Datura fruit, in delusion, mistaking it for lemon, and it was well eaten by all.


And then they became insane and fallen from the path, falling into the dense blindness, into the low grounds.


Cut all over the body by thorns, with broken arms, thighs, and feet, they insulted each other and quarreled loudly.


With fists, stones, and sticks, they struck each other, then, torn all over the body, they reached some city.


At midnight, by fate, they approached the city gate, and were blocked by the guards at the entrance.


Without knowledge of place and time, they quarreled loudly. Then, when they were excessively struck by the gatekeepers.


Then, intent on fleeing, they became scattered around. Some fell into the ditch and some were devoured by crocodiles and others.


Some fell into pits and wells and gave up their lives. Others were killed by them, and some were taken into captivity.


Thus, people with desires of welfare, unconscious by the poison of duty, alas, go to great destruction, indeed, greatly blinded by delusion.


You are blessed, Bhargava, because you have reached prosperity. Contemplation is indeed the root of all and the first step.


In attaining the highest good, the great mansion, know in every way that without good contemplation, whose attainment of welfare would be possible?


Lack of contemplation is supreme death; people destroyed by lack of contemplation. One who contemplates conquers everywhere by desirable associations.


Without contemplation, demons and ogres are destroyed in every way. The gods, full of contemplation, enjoy happiness in every way.


Relying on Vishnu through contemplation, they always conquer enemies. Contemplation is the seed and sprout energy of the tree of happiness.


A man shines by contemplation, greater in every way. By contemplation, the order is excellent. By contemplation, Vishnu is worshipped.


Indeed, by contemplation, Shiva, the great Lord, was all-knowing. Without contemplation, Rama, the best among the wise, was attached to the deer.


In great distress, then, by contemplation, building a bridge over the ocean, Rama attacked the city of Lanka filled with demons.


Without contemplation, even Brahma became foolish due to pride and attained beheading. Thus, it is indeed heard by you.


The great god, Shiva, without contemplation, giving a boon to the demon, indeed afraid of turning to ashes himself, resorted to fleeing.


Without contemplation, Vishnu previously killed Bhrigu's wife. By the curse, he attained great sorrow and suffered extremely unbearable distress.


Thus, others, gods, deities, demons, men, and animals, due to lack of contemplation, indeed attain distress.


O Bhargava, greatly fortunate are those wise ones, who are never abandoned by contemplation, salutations to them continually.


Attaining duty without contemplation, they become deluded everywhere. By contemplating and doing, one is freed from all boundless distress.


Thus, for a long time, this lack of contemplation became associated with people. As long as there is lack of contemplation, where would be reflection?


In the summer, in the desert heated by intense rays, where is cool water? Thus, one is surrounded by the long-lasting fire of lack of contemplation and flames of impurities.


How would the cool touch of contemplation be without the means? But the means here is one, indeed, the means is supreme and greater in every way.


The supreme grace of the deity residing in the lotus of all hearts, without that, how would there be easy attainment of great welfare for anyone?


The sun of contemplation is the dispeller of the great darkness of lack of contemplation. There, the root would be worship of the deity with devotion.


The supreme goddess, when completely worshipped and pleased, then attains the form of contemplation, like the sun in the sky of the mind.


Therefore, worship Tripura, the supreme goddess, dwelling within all, the great goddess of consciousness, auspicious.


Worship without deceit through the true guru gradually. In worship, the root would be devotion and pure faith.


There also, the root is praised as hearing its greatness. Therefore, to you first, Rama, the greatness has been told.


By hearing that, now you have attained auspiciousness. Contemplation is the root of prosperity because you are not afraid.


Until the rise of contemplation, there is great fear. Daily affected by the defect of lack of contemplation.


As indeed, affected by disorder, by taking medicine, similarly until the impurity of the element is removed, there would be fear.


Attaining supreme contemplation, life becomes fruitful for men. In all births of men, until there is supreme contemplation.


So many trees of birth are barren due to the cause of fruitlessness. Even that tree of birth is indeed fruitful where there is contemplation.


Men are like well-frogs without contemplation, as a frog born in a well does not know anything.


Good or bad, in the well it perishes. Likewise, people are born in vain in the well of the universe.


Good or bad, they do not know of themselves anywhere. Arising again and again, they perish, not knowing their own benefit.


Understanding happiness in sorrow and sorrow in happiness, due to the greatness of lack of contemplation, so they are cooked in the fire of transmigration.


Afflicted by sorrow and not abandoning it in any way, just as a great donkey, even when struck by a hundred foot blows.


People indeed follow the cycle of transmigration like donkeys. But you, O Rama, with contemplation, have reached beyond sorrow.


Chapter 3
Hearing the words spoken by Dattatreya, extremely curious, Jamadagni's son (Parashurama) asked again with humility.


O Lord, what has been spoken by you is true; without contemplation, great destruction has entirely been attained by people.


By contemplation, prosperity would be attained, and its cause is also heard. Hearing of greatness is indicated here, yet, there is a great doubt.


How can that also be obtained, and what would be the means? If it is natural, why has it not been heard by all?


Until today, I have not attained direction here. Sorrow obtained more by me, and I am defeated at every step.


The means have not been obtained from anywhere; kindly tell me this. Thus asked, Dattatreya, the ocean of compassion, spoke again, pleased.


Listen, O Rama, I will tell the supreme cause of prosperity. Association with the good is the supreme root, the removal of all sorrow.


In attaining the ultimate goal, the seed is said to be the association with the good. You also, by the association with the good Samvarta, the great soul.


Associated with him, you have attained this state, the rise of the fruit of prosperity. Indeed, the good, when associated, give supreme happiness.


Without association with the good, by whom has supreme prosperity been attained? In the world also, whatever association one attains, accordingly, the man becomes.


That fruit he attains in every way, there is no doubt. Here I will narrate to you; listen, O Rama, to this story.


Once, there was a king of Dasharna known as Muktachuda. His two sons were Hemachuda and Manichuda.


Both handsome and virtuous, skilled in all knowledge. Once, due to enthusiasm for hunting, surrounded by the army.


They entered the terrible forest of Sahya mountain, filled with lions, tigers, etc., very powerful and carrying bows and arrows.


Then there, they killed deer, lions, boars, buffaloes, and wolves with sharp arrows swiftly released from the bow.


Thus, while the princes were killing wild animals, a fierce wind appeared, showering gravel and stones.


The sky was covered with dust, becoming like night. There, neither rock, tree, nor person could be seen.


How could one see high from low, with the mountain covered in darkness? Struck by the shower of gravel, the army completely fled.


Some took shelter by trees, some by rocks, some by caves. Mounted on horses, the princes also fled far.


Hemachuda, somewhere there, reached a hermitage of ascetics, surrounded by groves of plantains and date palms, very beautiful.


There he saw an auspicious girl, like a flame, shining with a body glowing like heated gold.


Seeing her, the prince, smiling, asked, "Who are you, lotus-faced, in the forest?"


Residing as if fearless in this desolate, fear-inducing place, whose are you, and by whom do you live here alone? How?


Questioned thus, the blameless girl spoke to the prince, "Welcome, prince, please take a seat."


This is the duty of ascetics, indeed, to worship a guest. I see you are tired and distressed by the fierce wind.


Thus, while the princes were killing wild animals, a fierce wind appeared, showering gravel and stones.


Tying the horse to a date palm tree, sitting there, relieved of fatigue, he thus told, "You deserve to hear my story."


She made him eat fruits and drink juice. Thus, the blameless girl made the prince obtain rest.


She spoke with a sweet, honey-flowing voice, "Prince, Vyaghrapada is the sage, a follower of Shiva."


By whom the most virtuous worlds were conquered by the strength of his penance, knower of the highest and lowest, indeed, always worshipped by the leaders of sages.


I am rightfully his daughter, known as Hemalekha, born of the virtuous Vidyutprabha, one who is enchanting in all parts.


Once, along the Vena river, she came to bathe. Then, consequently, Sushena, the king of Vanga, came there.


He saw her, the world beauty, bathing in the river, her pair of breasts clearly visible through the wet cloth.


Struck by love's arrow, he desired her there, then she, enchanted by beauty, accepted his words.


Uniting with her, the king then went towards his city. She, the virtuous one, also bore a pregnancy from the rajarishi’s strength.


Afraid of offending her husband, she abandoned the pregnancy and came here. Born of the rajarishi’s unfailing strength, I am the girl, then.


Vyaghrapada saw me, who came for evening worship, with compassion, taking me up and protecting me like a mother.


By duty, he who is called a protector, indeed like a father, he. I am his rightful daughter, devoted to serving the father.


By his greatness, I have no fear here or indeed anywhere. This place is never invaded by gods, demons, or evil minds.


To enter the hermitage you may be worthy, but entering, one may attain no fear. This is my story stated. Stay a little, prince.


The venerable father will come, behold him. Bowing to him, having received his wishes, then in the morning, you may leave.


Then, noticing the prince under the control of desire, the wise girl spoke again, "Prince, take composure."


"Father is coming soon; then seek what you desire." While she was speaking, the great sage Vyaghrapada arrived.


He arrived from the forest, gathering leaves, flowers, etc. Seeing the sage arriving, the prince stood up.


Bowing and announcing his name, he sat down as instructed. Then, seeing the prince with a distorted appearance due to desire,


Knowing everything with yogic vision and considering it appropriate, the sage gave Hemalekha to him for marriage.


The pleased prince, taking her, went to the city. Muktachuda, very pleased, celebrated with great festivity.


The king performed his marriage according to the rules. Then the prince was also always engaged in play with her.


In palaces, forests, and riverbanks, the prince spent time with Hemalekha, who was not very desirous of enjoyments.


Seeing her always indifferent, he asked in private, "Dear, why are you not affectionate towards me, who is affectionate to you?"


"Dear with a pure smile, why are you not extremely attached to enjoyments? Are the enjoyments not appealing to you here? Why is this?"


"In excellent enjoyments, you seem not to be attached to me. Lacking attachment in you, how can my love be pleasing?"


"Though I am attached to you, you appear with your mind elsewhere. Even when I speak repeatedly, you do not seem to hear anything."


"Even after a long time, when I arrive, embracing your neck, you ask, 'When did you come, lord?' as if unaware."


"In pleasing, rare enjoyments, your mind is not attached at all. Why do you not approve of anything?"


"Indeed, when I approach and see you without me, with closed eyes, I envision you staying there."


"Indifferent to enjoyments and objects, how would my happiness be, like one associated with a wooden doll?"


"Not abandoning your wish, my intention means nothing. I entirely follow you like the lotus follows the moonlight, indeed."


"Thus, tell where your mind is, dearer than life. By which my mind would be purified, you are requested, dear."


Chapter 4
Hearing her dear’s words while embracing his neck, she, with a slight smile, spoke to the prince, blameless.


Desiring to enlighten the prince with reason, she spoke: “Prince, listen to my words, I am not indifferent to you.”


What is most dear in the world and what is not dear? Deep thinking always does not reach an end here; this is my thought.


I have contemplated this for a long time, always due to the nature of a woman. I do not know this truth; you should tell me truly.


Thus spoken, Hemachuda, smiling, said to his dear, “Indeed, women are foolish; this is true without a doubt.”


Indeed, animals, birds, and reptiles know what is dear and not dear because it is seen in their behavior towards what is dear and not dear.


Engagement and disengagement, what is there to think much about it? Happiness makes something dear, sorrow makes something not dear.


Why do you always think with bewilderment here, dear? Hearing the dear words, Hemalekha again said to her dear,


True, women are bewildered and lack proper contemplation. Even so, I should be enlightened by you with proper contemplation.


Well enlightened by you, I will leave this worry. By you, I will always enjoy daily thereafter.


O king, indeed, happiness and sorrow become yours by determining what is dear and not dear through subtle contemplation.


Indeed, one’s happiness and sorrow are created by differences in time, place, and form. Why is that determined as the basis here?


Because fire gives different results due to differences in time, likewise, due to differences in place and form,


In cold time, fire is dear, but in heat, surely not dear. Due to differences in cold and hot places, it is dear and not dear.


For beings of cold nature, it is dear, and for others, the opposite. Thus, it is indicated with higher or lesser degrees too.


Thus, similar to cold, wealth, wives, sons, kingdom, and likewise other things, are also dear thus, even a great king surrounded by wives, sons, and wealth,


Why does he grieve daily, and why do others not grieve? This enjoyment for happiness is also an endless pursuit.


That whole happiness has not been obtained by anyone. Whatever little happiness is gained, listen about that too.


That does not become happiness, lord, when it is mixed with sorrow. But sorrow is said to be twofold: external and internal.


External sorrow arises from the body due to imbalance of elements and so on. Internal sorrow is said to be mental, arising from desire.


The greater mental suffering by which this world is grasped is indeed desire, the seed of the tree of sorrow with strong power.


By desire they serve, they have attained, doing indeed day and night, even Indra and the wise ones, dwelling in heaven, this is always known.


O prince, the happiness that remains even after the fulfillment of desire, know that as sorrow which happens even in worms.


Better is the happiness of animals, insects, worms, and so on, combined with small desires. What is the happiness of men when they have small desires, say.


If someone filled with hundreds of desires achieves something, then they would become happy here, say.


If the entire body is burned by fire, and a small drop of sandalwood paste cools it, then he also would be happy.


From the embrace of the beloved, a man gets happiness indeed. There itself, from the awkward binding of the body if separated, sorrow would be indeed.


From the intensity of pleasure, exhaustion arises in all indeed. Thereafter, fatigue is like that of a beast of burden.


How do you see that as happiness, lord? Let this be told to me, as long as happiness arises in the company of the beloved from the friction of nerves.


Is your happiness not so much, like that of dogs here? Then, indeed, exceeding that is your happiness from perceived beauty.


That arises only from ego, like in the dream, union with a woman. Long ago, a prince, more beautiful than Cupid.


A prince, more beautiful than Cupid, attained an all-enchanting woman and was extremely attached to her.


But she was attached in mind to another, a servant of the prince. The servant deceived that prince with a trick.


Giving excessive wine to him for enchanting, then sending an ugly maidservant to the intoxicated prince,


He enjoyed her, thinking her to be his wife, the world’s most beautiful. Thus, blinded by intoxication, the king’s son remained there for long.


Every day approaching the maidservant, he considered himself fortunate, “I have such a world’s most beautiful beloved.”


“I approach her daily, I have no equal anywhere.” Thus, after a long time, once by divine will,


The servant placed the drink and went to urgent duty. Then the prince drank that drink not excessively.


For that reason, he quickly went, his mind eager for pleasure, to the bed, mentally delightful, endowed with all prosperity of enjoyments.


The palace like that of the lord of gods situated in Nandana, he approached the maidservant on the bed, thinking her to be the princess.


Overwhelmed by the force of desire, he enjoyed with extreme pleasure. Then, discovering at the end of the pleasure, her to be maidservant with a distorted appearance,


Suspicious and indignant, thinking “What is this?” and “Where is my beloved?” he asked her in this way.


Being questioned thus by him, the maidservant, observing him sober, indeed frightened, not speaking anything, trembling then, thereafter,


Noticing the trouble and self-deception, the prince, with red eyes of anger, grabbed the maidservant’s hair with his left hand.


Taking the sword with his right hand, the prince, threatening her, said, “Speak the event as it happened.”


“Otherwise, your life will not last even for a moment.” Thus, hearing his words, frightened with the desire to save her life,


She told everything as it has happened for a long time and also showed him his wife’s association with the servant.


Somewhere on the ground, lying was the servant, dark with brown eyes, tall with dirty limbs, and a harsh, disgusting face.


Embracing her, exhausted from pleasure with all limbs in a feeling of love, his neck surrounded by her soft arms, his own wife,


Placing his face like a lotus in her feet, embracing tightly, her pair of thighs attached to his hands, her heavy breasts,


The prince saw her like a spring creeper covered with clusters of flowers, like Rohini attacked by Rahu.


Seeing her in this way, unconscious by sleep, extremely deluded, for a moment, thereafter attaining composure,


What the prince spoke, hear from me indeed. Shame on me, extremely ignoble, foolish, intoxicated, and deluded.


Shame on those deeply attached to women, shame on those lowest of men. Women are not anyone’s, like starlings on a tree.


What will I say about myself, foolish like a calf of a buffalo, knowing her, thinking her dearer than life, as my beloved for a long time?


Women are not anyone’s, like a prostitute to a rogue. Indeed, who is confident in women is like a wild donkey.


The state of an autumn cloud is momentary and unstable. Even more flimsy is the extremely fickle state of women.


Alas, till today, I did not know the nature of women. Abandoning me, who was wholly attached to her, she devoted herself to a servant.


Attached to another, greedy in mind, showing insincere love for me, displaying her own devotion like an actress in an actor’s troupe.


With mind intoxicated by wine, I did not know her even a bit, thinking she was attached to me like a shadow, confident trusting her in mind.


Certainly, who on earth would be more foolish than me, deceived and long-associated with that unattractive maidservant?


Who thus, with confidence, was long deceived by her. Alas, this wretched servant with a distorted form,


What beauty was seen in this by her, more than everywhere, even if my own beauty was taken as world-watching.


Entirely attached to the servant, abandoning him, she approached. Thus, lamenting variously, extremely disillusioned then,


The prince went to the forest, free from all attachments. Therefore, O prince, this beauty arises from the mind.


As you formerly found extreme pleasure in me, seeing my extreme beauty, likewise, especially that,


Many find extreme pleasure even in deformed women. Here, I will give you assurance. Listen attentively, dear.


A woman is seen externally well-formed, but that is also a reflection of her own self-form, residing in the mind.


Her beauty is drawn in the mind in the form of desire, repeatedly. After that, achieving the desire.


A man with agitated senses obtains pleasure in her everywhere. But with unagitated senses, there would not be pleasure even in beauty.


There, the repeated description of her beauty again and again is the root of agitation. But this agitation is not seen in children, not even in yogis.


Similarly, whoever finds pleasure in whom, a man describes beauty there, in a beautiful one or another.


Women with extremely ugly forms are seen, associated with young men for the sake of children.


If there is a description of deformity or non-description of beauty, how would men find pleasure in both indeed?


What is to be said, alas, of men with lustful, distracted minds? Beauty shines more everywhere, even in inferior parts.


If one sees beauty in parts smeared with filth and urine, where would one not see beauty shining then?


Therefore, this beauty, indeed, O prince, observe. Without pride, it would not be the cause of happiness anywhere.


If beauty in the body is like the sweetness of honey, then why does it not shine in children or boys like that?


In different regions, various forms of men are seen: one-legged, one-eyed, long-eared, horse-faced.


Ear-covered, forehead-faced, protruding teeth, without nose, long-nosed, covered with hair, reverse-haired.


With tawny hair, white hair, disheveled hair, thick hair, leprosy spots, crow-colored, yellowish, and reddish-bodied.


Thus, various mortals find pleasure among women of the same species, like you, O prince, observe.


In sources of pleasure, the main one is the female form, dear to all, where all, even the wise ones, are deluded.


Likewise, consider the form of men and women, extremely beautiful and dear, with good intellect, as it is, O prince.


Smeared with flesh, soaked in blood, bound by veins, covered with skin, a skeleton covered with hair, filled with bile and phlegm.


Filled with filth and urine, born of semen and blood, arising from the urinary passage, alas, this is desired here.


Men who indulge in pleasure in such extremely repulsive conditions, tell me, where is their difference from worms in excrement?


O prince, this body is extremely dear to you. Consider with discernment the separate existence of its elements.


Thus, consider the nature of sweet, sour, etc. similarly, six tastes elsewhere to be used, indeed, see with subtle vision.


Even of all that is eaten, its transformation into excrement is realized by all in every way, indeed without doubt.


Tell me, thus established in the world, what would be dear and what not dear? Thus spoken, Hemacuda then realized indifference in the subject.


Hearing the unprecedented speech, he became immediately astonished, reflecting again on all that was said by Hemalekha.


With disinterest in pleasures arisen, he attained supreme detachment. Then, gradually asking her, his beloved, and knowing that state,


Realizing the consciousness established in the self, Tripura in the form of the self, he became a liberated soul, seeing everything as self.


He became liberated while living. Then, his younger brother Manicuda also realized, from his brother, then Muktacuda also from his son.


Manicuda’s beloved also attained knowledge from the daughter-in-law. Ministers and citizens also became full of knowledge.


No one was born ignorant in that city. It became known as Brahma’s city, an abode of peaceful cycles of birth and death.


That great city appeared very excellent in the world, where parrots and mynah birds recited in cages, indeed.


Worship your own self as the form of consciousness, without awareness. There is no other awareness apart from consciousness, like a mirror’s reflection.


Consciousness, awareness, I am consciousness, all moving and non-moving, since all follows consciousness and shines, indeed, independently.


Therefore, people, all worship the shining, all-pervading consciousness, abandoning delusion, with clear vision of pure consciousness.


Once, hearing the magnificent speech of the parrots, the Brahmins, starting with Vamadeva, announced the name of the city.


Because here even the animals recite knowledge, therefore, let this city be renowned by the name “Famous City of Knowledge.”


Even today, that city is established by that name. O Rama, therefore, indeed, association with the good is the root for all auspiciousness.


By the association with Hemalekha, all became knowledgeable. Therefore, O Rama, know that association is the supreme root for prosperity.
Chapter 5
Thus, hearing the greatness of good company spoken by the son of Atri, delighted in mind, he commenced to ask again.
True is this spoken by you, O lord, as the cause of auspiciousness, this form of good company, indeed realized by direct experience.
As one obtains association, so would be the fruit of that. Women also, by association with Hemalekha, obtained great fruits.
Again, I desire to hear how Hemacuda was enlightened by her. Tell me that in detail, O ocean of compassion.
Thus questioned by Rama, Dattatreya spoke to him. Listen, O descendant of Bhrigu, I will tell the supremely purifying story.
Thus, hearing her words and knowing the objects to be tasteless, he became disinterested and disheartened.
Controlled by long-standing sensory desires, he was not able to suddenly abandon or hold them.
The prince, very ashamed, spoke nothing to his beloved. He spent some days thus, troubled in thought.
Attached to the objects, but remembering what was spoken by the woman, condemning himself, he indeed enjoyed under the control of desires.
Under the force of desires, he follows the objects, but seeing the faults in the objects, contemplating what his beloved had spoken.
His heart distressed by sorrow grieves again and again. Thus, his mind became like a swinging cradle.
Food, clothes, ornaments, women, vehicles, friends, or companions did not please him slightly, indeed.
As if having lost all wealth, he grieves continuously. Under the control of desires, he was not able to abandon all quickly.
Not able to enjoy, thus afflicted by faults, then, under the control of sorrow, seeing him pale-faced.
Hemalekha, observing him once, meeting in private, said, “Why, O lord, do you not appear as joyful as before?”
“I see you as if grieving. Why is your state thus? Perhaps your body is always afflicted by diseases?”
“In enjoyments, the wise ones say there is indeed a fear of disease, caused by the imbalance of the three doshas in the body.”
“Diseases generally pervade all bodies and are established. In every way, the imbalance caused by doshas is indeed unmanageable.”
“From food, clothes, words, sight, touch, also from time, place, and actions, the doshas obtain imbalance.”
“Therefore, its arising in the world has gone unnoticed in every way. Thus, being in imbalance, treatment is prescribed.”
Treatment is not prescribed anywhere in the absence of imbalance. Therefore, dear, tell me why indeed there is sorrow in you.
Thus hearing Hemalekha, the prince then said, “Dear, listen, I will tell you the cause of my sorrow.”
By your words, that which formerly gave me happiness is now destroyed. Indeed, I do not see anything now that increases my happiness.
The objects bestowed by the king, giving happiness all around, do not please the condemned. Therefore, my happiness is not.
Serving the objects always, like a condemned person, I ask you, dear, tell me, what should I do to attain happiness?
Thus questioned by him, Hemalekha then said, “Surely, he has rightly concluded by hearing my words.”
There is a seed for prosperity in this, because you are in this way. In those in whom such prosperity is inconceivable, they are by words also not affected.
Not indeed, even a little, are specially affected at any time, those for whom the well-worshipped deity residing in the heart is pleased.
In them, Tripura indeed would be such a state, thus considering, the very wise Hemalekha, intending to enlighten her dear,
Concealing her wisdom, she said indirectly, “Listen, prince, to this ancient event of mine.”
Formerly, my mother gave me a friend for playing. She, naturally virtuous, associated with some unvirtuous person.
She, endowed with various extraordinary creations, unnoticed by my mother, became associated with my friend.
My friend, excessively associated with bad conduct, was dearest to me, even more than life. Indeed, I was always under her control.
I cannot abandon her even for a moment, nor could she ever depart from me for even half a moment. She, by her pure nature, remained controlling me.
Constantly absorbed in her, I easily became of her nature. She was seen with the dancer of varied nature.
She was accepted in remote activity, appointed by her son. Her son was very foolish, with eyes rolling in intoxication.
He enjoyed her by force, always before me. She, with all limbs seized by him, being enjoyed daily.
She never left me, touched by him and also I didn’t leave. Then, a son was born, of the fool, of similar appearance.
He quickly became young, very fickle in nature, joined by the father’s foolishness and the grandmother’s quality.
Surrounded by the ability to create many wonders, due to the grandmother named Shunya, and the father named Mudha.
Asthira, trained and became very skilled himself, attained unimpeded and fast movement quickly.
Thus, my friend, pure-natured and virtuous by birth, attained excessive impurity by associating with the unvirtuous.
She, by her dear friend’s unvirtuous-natured son, by long association, became strongly attached to them.
My friend gradually abandoned affection for me completely. I, naturally simple, could not easily abandon that association.
Unable to abandon her due to intense devotion completely, I followed her. Then her foolish dear one, always enjoying her.
Forcibly eager to assault me completely, I, naturally pure, did not actually go under his control.
Even so, in the world, great slander about me became widespread. “She is completely enjoyed by the fool,” thus it was everywhere.
Placing her son named Asthira in me, my friend, embraced by her dear one, became completely devoted to that.
Then Asthira, well cherished and nurtured by me, grown, associated with a woman with his grandmother’s permission.
She, his dear one, named Capalā, indeed, every moment, her form different and delightful, pleasing to her dear one.
Holding the dear one, creating wonders, thus in her control, she took him, very skillful, by her expertise, indeed.
Asthira, even in a moment, goes and comes hundreds of yojanas, always, without fatigue.
Whenever Asthira desires to go anywhere, Capalā, making his desired form, also indeed
Remaining here and there, being, she pleases her dear one. Thus, Capalā, well joined with Asthira stayed
She gave birth to five sons, devoted to mother and father. They, capable, of five types, were placed in me by the friend.
I, attached to the friend, made them stronger. Then, those five sons of Capalā, grew separately.
They made a wonderful and very spacious best dwelling. Their father, under their control, was well inspired by the mother.
They bring their father to their own dwelling moment by moment. There, Asthira, residing in the eldest son’s dwelling, indeed
He heard various sounds, melodious and others also. Somewhere sweet music, somewhere very pleasant instrumental music.
He heard Rigveda hymns, Yajurveda hymns, Samaveda hymns, Atharvaveda hymns, mantras, scriptures, doctrines, histories, and the jingling of ornaments.
Hearing the song of the swarm of bees and the melodious fifth note of the cuckoo, thus he heard delightful sounds at the direction of the son.
Pleased, he went under the control of the son, and then the son directed otherwise. He heard harsh, ear-piercing, and terrifying sounds.
He heard the roaring of lions and others, the rumbling of clouds, the thunder, the breaking of the universe, miscarriage, all very terrifying.
Thus, hearing, very frightened, he also heard elsewhere likewise, weeping, lamenting, various expressions of grief and others.
Led by the second son, then Asthira went to that dwelling. There he saw seats that were soft to the touch and auspicious.
He saw beds and clothes rough to the touch, objects cool to the touch, and also objects warm to the touch.
Seeing various objects neither warm nor cool to the touch, beneficial ones made him delighted, but he was distressed by harmful ones.
Then, reaching the third son’s dwelling, Asthira saw beautiful forms and objects of various colors.
Red, white, yellow and blue, green, pink, also smoky, dark, brown, metallic, and mottled.
Thick, thin, small, long, extended, round, also semi-circular, elongated circular, beautiful, and frightening.
Repulsive, shining, fierce, obscure, and dazzling. Somewhere beneficial, and seeing other from there, the father again.
The fourth son led to his wonderful dwelling. There, he obtained flowers, fruits, and food step by step.
Drinks, licked and sucked food, juicy indeed, nectar-like, sweet, other sour tastes, and.
Pungent and bitter, astringent also, some alkaline, sweet and sour, pungent, sour, and salty.
Pungent and bitter, various flavored, different also, tasting together with the son, then the last son.
Brought the father to his own place, extremely wonderful. There he obtained many flowers and fruits.
Herbs, food, medicinal plants, and other objects from all sides, fragrant, foul-smelling, mild-smelling, and strong-smelling.
Deluding scents, knowledge-enhancing scents, fainting-inducing scents, various scents. Thus, entering and residing in the dwellings of the sons.
He delights in beneficial things somewhere, grieves in harmful things somewhere. Always engaged in coming and going, he appeared in the dwellings of the sons.
The sons, out of affection for the father, are never without the father. They don’t touch various objects or on their own at any time.
Asthira, having enjoyed many objects in the son’s house, secretly takes other objects to his own place.
Asthira, together with his wife Chapala, secretly enjoys without the sons, always excessively.
Soon, Mahasana (his new wife) became attached to her beloved husband, Asthira. Asthira also became excessively attached to her.
Then, for her pleasure, he was intent on obtaining enjoyment. She ate everything that was brought by him in a moment.
Again overwhelmed by hunger for obtaining more enjoyment, she always directs her dear one to obtain more, so he also always looks to obtain more.
Brought by the five sons, well-provided by the dear one, having eaten momentarily, again she was tormented by hunger.
To obtain enjoyment, she always directs her dear one and his sons. Then, in a short time, she gave birth to a pair of sons.
Jwalamukha, the elder of the two, and Nindya Vrtta, the other one, both were also always the most dear to their mother.
When Asthira, with great attachment, embraces her, then Jwalamukha’s flames consume his entire body.
Asthira, extremely tormented, indeed attains deep unconsciousness. Sometimes, being associated with the dear son Nindya Vrtta.
Blamed by everyone, he indeed becomes like dead. Thus, by the sorrow of the son, my friend is extremely distressed.
My dear friend, naturally pure, out of great affection for her son named Asthira, was associated with him and distressed due to sorrow.
Overwhelmed by the burden of sorrow, associated with Nindya Vrtta, and Jwalamukha, and also others, being embraced by sons.
Badly burnt, blamed by people, she indeed became almost dead. I, always following her, became almost lost, dear.
Thus, distressed by the sorrow of my friend for many years, and Asthira became not independent due to being dedicated to Mahasana
He reached the city with ten gates by some action somewhere. In that, he was associated with Mahasana, because of his sons, mother, and others.
He dwelled, desiring happiness, but experiencing sorrow day and night. Was burnt all over the body by the sons, and blamed daily.
Dragged here and there by the dear ones, always indeed. Entering and residing in the five dwellings of his sons.
Extremely fatigued, he does not obtain happiness anywhere. Thus, by the sorrow of her son, my friend is extremely distressed.
She became as if unconscious, thus dwelled in that city, associated with Jwalamukha and Nindya Vrtta, she was greatly attached.
Nourished by Shunyakya (grandmother) and the foolish father-in-law, likewise supported extremely by his wife named Chapala.
Residing in that city, she was under the control of her husband and Asthira. By the affection of my friend, I lived there, being devoted to that.
Almost destroyed by the sorrow of the friend, but intent on protecting all. If I were not there even for a moment, dear,
There would not be anyone, and by me indeed all are protected. Obtained emptiness by Shunyakya, as one obtains foolishness by the foolish.
By Asthira, instability and fickleness being associated with Chapala. By Jwalamukha, burning and Nindya Vrtta, that was his identity.
By association with the friend, thus I became of this particular form. If I were to leave the friend, that form would perish in a moment.
By association with them, they indeed call me unfaithful. All the foolish people think so, but the wise know me as pure.
My mother, the great chaste one, pure and spotless in form, even vaster than the sky, and subtler than an atom.
All-knowing, yet knowing nothing, all-doer, yet inactive, support of all, yet unsupported, foundation of all, yet unfounded.
Having all forms, yet formless, having all, yet unconnected, shining everywhere, yet not known by anyone, anywhere.
Although full of great joy, she is devoid of joy, she is without mother and father. Children like me of her are countless.
Like the countless waves of the ocean, all are group of sisters, all of them are like me in behavior, O prince, indeed.
I, having great mantra, am associated with all these groups of friends, devoted to that, I’m also like a mother in essence.
In this city, when the son of my friend becomes very tired, then Asthira sleeps completely in the lap of his mother.
But when Asthira is asleep, then his sons and others also attain sleep; no one else remains awake.
Then the dear friend named Pracara protects the city of Asthira, always moving around at the pair of eastern gates.
The mother of Asthira, who is my friend, due to her son, and her husband, she is an unchaste mother-in-law by her nature.
She, covering all of them, protects them together with her son. Thus, when all are asleep, she reaches her own mother then.
I become delighted, embraced by the mother for a long time, indeed. But again, quickly follow them when they arise daily.
This mighty friend of Asthira, named Pracara, nourishes all headed by Asthira daily.
He, becoming many from one, pervades and protects the city and its inhabitants daily, uniting all.
Without him, they indeed would be separated and lost completely, like pearls devoid of the thread strung in a garland separately.
Thus he joins and unites me greatly with all, greatly enlivened by me, indeed the thread bearer in that city.
But when that city is old, he quickly takes them to another city. Thus, relying on Pracara, he became the ruler of cities.
Indeed, unstable in many diverse ways gradually, the chaste son Asthira, though dependent, is mighty.
Influenced by me extremely in every way, he is the bearer of suffering from union with the wives Chapala and Mahashana.
Dragged everywhere by Jwalamukha and Nindya Vrtta named sons, and by other five sons.
Afflicted soul with great distress, devoid of slightest happiness, dragged here and there by his five sons.
Somewhere moved extremely by Chapala, afflicted with fatigue, somewhere runs for food due to Mahashana.
Somewhere moved by Jwalamukha, burned from feet to head, attains great fainting, and unaware of any remedy.
Obtaining with Nindya Vrtta somewhere, reproached and scolded by others, he considers himself like the dead, continuously in grief.
With a bad wife and sons, deluded, born of a bad family, always overwhelmed and being led by them.
He lived with them in various cities, high and low, indeed, sometimes in wild regions filled with carnivorous beings.
Sometimes in extremely hot places, sometimes in extremely cold, sometimes in foul-smelling places, sometimes in dense darkness.
Thus again with great sorrow, afflicted with her son, Asthira, my friend became deeply distressed, always in bad association.
Though true to nature, foolishly I followed her, dear, like a fool, extremely devoted to her family.
Who indeed can obtain even a little happiness from bad association anywhere, like a man seeking cool comfort in a summer desert?
Thus, after a long time passing, my friend, deluded with great sorrow, she associated with me in private.
Obtaining single-minded association with me, having met a good husband, conquering her son, killing, and binding his sons and others.
Associating with me, she quickly reached my mother’s city, embracing my mother repeatedly, who is pure.
Immersed in the ocean of bliss, she became that instantly. Thus, you also, controlling bad conduct arising from the friend.
Obtaining your mother, lord, always obtain happiness. This is told to you, lord, as a self-experienced source of happiness.
Chapter 6
Hearing these sweet words, Hemachuda, very surprised, laughed and asked her, dear and wise.


Dear, what you have spoken seems strange to me and are unsupported words; today I understand this completely.


Surely, you are born of a nymph, raised by a sage in the forest, who has not yet fully reached adulthood, still in budding youth.


You speak words resembling a possessed being's speech, claiming to have lived for many thousand years. 


Without context, how can I understand this truly? Tell me, where is your friend and where is the friend's son bound?


How old or where are those established? Be it so, what about that event? Tell me where is that friend.


I consider that I have not obtained any such friend of my mother’s, a noble lady in seclusion, nor my own, or my father's, no other dear to me.


Where is my friend or her son? Tell me quickly. I think your words are like a barren woman's son in the world.


Your words are like some actor said something in jesting speech or a barren woman's son mounted on an illusory great chariot.


Or, with oyster shells made to look like golden ornaments adorning the body, or fighting with weapons made from human horns in the sky forest.


Having killed the future king and won the celestial city, or indeed plays with dream maidens in the stream of illusion.


Thus, I think your words are entirely unrelated. Hearing this, she cleverly said to him again.


Lord, how can what I have spoken to you be meaningless? Words of people like me are never unsupported anywhere.


Falsehood indeed is the destroyer of ascetics; where is she among those of truthful character? Why would there be beauty like a corpse in the family of ascetics?


Who engages the inquisitive for other purposes falsely, for him there is neither upward nor downward world as means of happiness.


Listen, prince, to my words: sometimes in the world, a blind person does not attain even vision quickly even with words of medical eyewash.


The foolish mind knows only falsehood and not beneficially spoken words. Dear, why would I engage you, the inquisitive, by falsehoods?


Even if I have spoken falsehood, consider that with a sound mind. Indeed, in the world, a skilled mortal is skilled in all conduct, indeed.


Examining partially, one understands all conditions. I will give you an example, observe here.


Which object was formerly the means to the desired goal? For so long, it was my words, then how is it not a means of happiness today?


He indeed accomplishes happiness in others now, how? You should know your belief by this example.


Listen, O king, to what I say with straightforward and pure intellect. A distrustful enemy in the world becomes firm in trustworthy sayings.


Faith, like a loving mother, always protects the surrendered one from great fears in every way; indeed, there is no doubt.


Prosperity, happiness, and fame leave the foolish and faithless in the trustworthy. He who is without faith becomes entirely devoid of these.


Faith is indeed the nourisher of the worlds, faith is the life of all. Say, in this matter, how can a faithless child live with the mother?


How can a faithless young man flourish with happiness in his wife? Similarly, how can an old man go on the virtuous path, without faith in his children?


Why would a faithless farmer plow the earth? There would be no activity anywhere, neither in renunciation nor in acquisition without faith.


Due to the lack of faith, the existence of the worlds would perish. If worldly activity comes from complete acceptance, listen.


Even in complete acceptance, why is faith established? There also, the sole refuge is indeed the refuge in faith.


Therefore, without faith, the world would surely perish, just like without breathing. Therefore, obtaining firm faith, go to the ultimate happiness.


If you think faith is not to be placed in the lower, listen. Any activity indeed exists by faith, O prince.


Hearing the beloved's words, Hemachuda said again to the skilled speaker, his beloved, "How would your activity be thus?"


Indeed, dear, faith should be placed in every way, when it is to be placed in faith. Faith should be placed in the good, by which welfare is attained.


Faith should not be placed in the bad by one desirous of welfare. Otherwise, it is like a sharp, crooked hook inside.


Just as fish meet destruction by well-ground bait outside, therefore faith should indeed be placed in the good, not in the untruth anywhere.


Those who placed faith in the bad attained destruction, and others also. Examples are those united with welfare, due to faith in the good.


Therefore, believing is indeed proper for faith, not otherwise. Thus, “How would your activity be thus?” was your question.


Thus spoken, Hemalekha said again to her dear husband, "Listen, O prince, to these words being said by me."


You said this question asking how. There, I say to you, "How is your certainty about this being or non-being?"


If there is certainty in the truth, it should become good with faith here indeed. That would also be by characteristics if faith is associated with characteristics.


If knowledge of characteristics is from evidence, then listen to this: What evidence is there for one who lacks faith? Let that be well examined.


Otherwise, the knower would not be contradicted anywhere. Therefore, the whole world operates by relying on faith.


I will explain that method; listen with a steady mind. About unsettled reasoning or no reasoning at all, in every way.


The world would not attain welfare here or hereafter. Sometimes, without reasoning, welfare may come by chance.


For unsettled reasoning, welfare would not come in any way. Once upon a time, on the Sahya mountain by the Godavari river, there was a sage named Kaushika.


He lived with a calm mind, knowing the true nature of the world. Hundreds of his disciples stayed by the guru’s guidance.


One day, they approached the guru to determine the state of the world, according to their intellect, and then they spoke to each other.


There came a highly learned brahmin named Shunga. He refuted the stated opinions of all by his skill in reasoning.


Then, without faith and having lost wisdom, but skillful in debate, he said among the brahmins, "Truth is what is measured from evidence."


Relying only on unsettled reasoning, Shunga refuted all in the debate there.


"O Brahmins, listen to my words. Truth is nowhere established. What is measured by evidence is said to be the truth."


There, indeed, by that defect, it would be immeasurable. First, the defectlessness of the evidence should be ascertained.


Thus, even that created by other evidence should be considered. Thus, from uncertainty, nothing would be measured.


Therefore, the knower, the measured, and the evidence do not establish. Therefore, based on emptiness, indeed, this various alternative exists.


Even he attained a state of emptiness due to lack of evidence. Therefore, nothing, emptiness is real; thus, this is the conclusion.


Thus, hearing Shunga's words, some lowly brahmins among them followed him, becoming proponents of emptiness with apparent certainty.


Those devoted to that went to destruction, attaining the state of emptiness. Those brahmins with strong hearts rejected Shunga's words.


Analyzing by Kaushika, they became composed at heart. Therefore, completely abandoning that unsettled reasoning.


Reasoning always dependent on true scriptures would attain welfare. Thus was Hemachuda told by his extremely wise beloved.


Again, extremely astonished, he asked her, "Oh dear, I did not know before of your such wisdom."


Blessed are you, and blessed am I who has approached you. You say that with faith one attains all auspiciousness. How is that?


Where should faith be placed and where is it not recommended? Due to the multitude of scriptures and their contradictory meanings.


Due to differences in the opinions of teachers and commentators, and the instability of one's own intellect, what should be accepted or not?


What is dear to one, he declares as certain, and another's view is undecided, causing harm, dear one.


No one reaches the end here in deciding which is true or not. He who says truth is emptiness criticizes non-emptiness of another.


From where can one know that though unbelievable is consistent with scriptures? Tell this correctly, dear. Indeed, this is not unconsidered by you.
Chapter 7
Thus questioned by her dearest husband, Hemalekha, wise and well-acquainted with the state of the world, replied rightly.


Listen, dearest, with a steady mind and respect, I will tell you. The mind, indeed, is always unstable like a monkey.


Because of this, ordinary people have obtained great misfortune. An unstable mind is seen as the cause of all suffering.


Because in deep sleep, due to the absence of movement, one finds happiness. Therefore, stabilizing the mind, listen to what I say to you.


What is heard with disrespect becomes as if not heard. It is absolutely fruitless, like seeking support from a painted tree.


Abandoning unstable reasoning, which is destructive, people relying on sound reasoning quickly obtain good results.


By relying on sound reasoning, one quickly becomes dedicated to one means. Having attained faith generated by sound reasoning, a man bears fruit here.


Abandoning that unstable reasoning, see, dear, this activity of the world which is fruitful with faith.


With sound reasoning over time, a farmer tills the earth. Likewise, with faith, one obtains silver, gold, gems, and medicines.


They decide with sound reasoning, abandoning unstable arguments. Therefore, with sound reasoning and faith, one should decide the welfare of oneself.


One should strive for its attainment, not relying on unstable arguments. One should not desist from effort and striving, like the followers of Shunga.


With faith, one dedicated to effort should not be hindered in any way. Relying on firm effort, how can one not achieve the result?


Through effort, farmers obtain grains, merchants obtain wealth, kings obtain the kingdom's wealth, and scholars obtain knowledge, the foundation of all happiness.


Laborers obtained wages, gods obtained nectar, ascetics obtained the highest world, and others obtained their desired goals through effort indeed.


With unstable reasoning and without faith, what result has a person ever obtained? Tell me, considering that.


Sometimes, due to failure to achieve results and absence of assurance everywhere, one should understand him as afflicted by fate, appearing as one's own enemy.


Therefore, relying on effort nourished by faith and sound reasoning, one should resort to that foremost means of welfare.


There is observed diversity of means, and among them, one should achieve that which is achievable in every way, as that is indeed the principal.


Deciding through sound reasoning and experience, one should quickly begin. I will explain all that to you. Listen attentively.


One should know that welfare from which one does not grieve again. Grief is seen everywhere by subtle vision.


That which is intertwined with griefs is not welfare in any way; wealth, sons, wives, kingdom, treasury, strength, and fame.


Knowledge, intellect, sight, body, beauty, and wealth—all these are unstable, placed in the mouth of the serpent of time.


Situated as the seed of the great power of the sprout of grief, how can it be deserving of suitability for ultimate welfare?


Therefore, the highest welfare primarily lies in this; thus, in the matter of wealth, etc., there is a delusion of desirability.


Arisen from delusion, the great lord is the deluder, who indeed is the creator of all worlds; therefore, all are deluded.


Even a little people are deluded here due to a portion of knowledge; some indeed, not all, because that knowledge is limited.


Even people with little knowledge have surpassed the deluder in deluding; then who is capable of surpassing the great god, the great deluder?


Who in the world knows the little delusion by counter-knowledge, he, having emerged from delusion, remains calm and obtains eternal happiness.


Even such knowledge is not attainable without resorting to the deluder until one pleases him in every way.


Therefore, without pleasing the great deluder, how can one cross the great delusion? Therefore, one should resort to him in every way.


Whoever pleases him properly, having attained his grace, will certainly achieve transcendence from that delusion through great knowledge.


Other practices mentioned for achieving welfare would not yield results without the grace of the great lord.


Therefore, one should first worship the great lord, the cause of the universe, with devotion, and quickly accomplish practices that destroy delusion.


This world is seen directly as an effect, along with its parts, thus beginning with the earth, even with an unseen cause, sufficiently.


By reasoning thus, firmly established by many scriptures, one should ascertain a doer there, distinct from all doers.


Although some scripture here says the world is without a doer, that is well refuted by many scriptures established by reasoning.


Where the purpose is indeed self-destruction, based only on perception, that is merely the appearance of scripture, not a great authority.


Scripture solely constructed from dry logic should indeed be rejected. Others also say that this world is eternal.


If this world is considered as done by one without intelligence, it is also incongruous, as action is preceded by intelligence and that action is not observed in the absence of intelligence.


Supported by many scriptures, indeed, the doer here is intelligent. Action done by an intelligent doer is certainly observed there.


Thus, by sound reasoning and scriptures, this world has a doer, but that doer is distinct from worldly doers.


Due to the inconceivable nature of the effect, the doer has inconceivable and infinite power and unlimited capability, in conformity with the effect.


He is indeed capable of uplifting those who have surrendered in every way. Therefore, always take refuge in him with all your being.


I will state an example to you, listen to the reason with belief. Even a limited lord here in the world is pleased without deceit.


This lord of the world, properly pleased by someone, engages a man with desired objects for his welfare.


Tell me, what would the one who is the only affectionate to devotees not give to him? Indeed, men who are lords in the world are unstable and not affectionate.


Merciless and ungrateful, therefore their result is unstable. The supreme lord is an ocean of compassion, grateful, and well established.


Otherwise, in the beginningless cycle of existence, how could one attain faultlessness? Tell me, how could the world’s course be established?


Because the kingdom of the unstable is seen to be lost, therefore, he is described as an ocean of compassion and well established.


Quickly take refuge in him with all your being and devotion. He will engage you in welfare; do not go to subordination.


Worship is of various kinds, for the distressed and wealth-seeking, but somewhere there is also causeless worship, and that is true worship.


It is seen everywhere that when the lord is worshipped by the distressed, sometimes, overcome with compassion, he releases them from their distress.


Sometimes, he disregards worship due to differences; similarly, for wealth-seekers, the result is limited and uncertain.


Knowing the causelessness of the causeless worshipper after a long time, even the limited lord, being unstable, becomes dependent on that strength.


For knowing the causelessness, it may take a long time due to ignorance. This lord of all, is the lord of the heart of all, indeed.


The lord knows everything and quickly gives the result to the distressed and the wealth-seeker, engaging them with that purpose.


By his own law, waiting for the ripening of actions, the lord orders the result for the causeless worshipper who is his exclusive refuge.


Knowing this, the lord becomes the provider of well-being for all beings, without waiting for the ripening of actions, shaking off his own law.


Having accomplished that means, the lord quickly engages in the result; this indeed is lordship and great independence.


Destined law is also opposed by the lord; this is seen in the son of Mṛkaṇḍu, exceedingly devoted to the lord.


It is known by all that Maheśa can transgress the ordained fate. I will tell you the reasoning behind this; listen, dear to life.


Even though ordained fate is not to be transgressed, for those lacking determination, that fate is not negated.


Therefore, through breath control, fate is conquered. It does not impose sufferings sufficiently on those who are determined, this is seen.


Those who are swallowed by the serpent of fate, lacking determination, indeed experience this as designed by fate.


Fate is the power of the lord, solely of the nature of will. The true will of the lord is indeed not to be transgressed.


She becomes hindered when devoted to the supreme lord, and she also becomes unhindered because she becomes such.


Therefore, abandon faulty reasoning and take refuge in lord Maheśa. He causelessly engages you in welfare.


This is indeed the first step to the mansion of welfare. Leaving this, there is no fruit-bearing elsewhere.


Having heard these words, O Rāma, Hemachūḍa, with a very pleased mind, asked his dear again.


Dear, tell me about Maheśa, who can be my refuge, the creator of all, the independent self, by whose power the world is controlled.


Some call him Vishnu, others call him Shiva, Ganesha, also Surya, Narasimha, Buddha, and Sugata.


They have called him Arhant, Vasudeva, Prana, Soma, Pavaka, and said in many ways that action, the main principle, and atoms are him.


The form of the world's cause is divided by various beliefs. There, where should the understanding of the lord be considered?


It is certain that nothing is unknown to you because of the lord Vyāghrapāda, who has seen the past and future, has said so.


Therefore, you women also shine with this knowledge. Tell me, dear nectar-speaking one, faithfully.


Thus asked, Hemalekha, delighted, said to her dear, "Lord, I  will explain to you. Listen to the decision about the lord."


The lord is indeed the creator and dissolver of the universe. He is Vishnu, Shiva, the creator, Surya, and Soma.


He is indeed all in every way, designated by all. He is not Shiva, not even Vishnu, nor the creator, nor another.


I will explain this to you; listen very focused. They say Shiva, the five-faced and three-eyed, is the creator.


He is the creator, like a conscious potter with a body. In the world also, a conscious creator with a body is seen.


A bodiless or unconscious entity is never observed as the doer anywhere. Therefore, the principal doership is indeed only possible for the conscious.


Because in dreams, this soul, leaving the gross body, creates all desired things with a body of consciousness.


Therefore, the body is an instrument in the actions of the conscious self. Because living beings depend on instruments, their independence is incomplete.


Indeed, the Lord, the creator of the world, due to complete independence, creates everything without depending on anything, without deficiency.


Therefore, the body does not exist; this is the principal conclusion. Otherwise, like the world, the doer would depend on a material cause.


Thus, by the collection of causes like place and time, the Lord creating the world would indeed become a living being.


Complete sovereignty would be destroyed in the creation of the world earlier as well. The doership of all would be obstructed; there is no doubt.


Therefore, indeed, the world is created without depending on a visible body. Therefore, the gross body does not exist in reality, beloved of life.


In the supreme form, indeed, the gross-minded are deluded in this bodiless form. The devoted, meditating wherever and however, are not.


Thus, the wish-fulfilling gem for devotees assumes many forms itself. Therefore, indeed, the Lord is conscious, and his body would be supreme consciousness.


Consciousness is indeed the great existence, the empress, the supreme goddess. Tripura shines in whom, undivided yet appearing as divided.


This moving and non-moving world is like a city of illusion. Due to the oneness of its form, there is no notion of high and low.


Others, indeed, imagine primary and other forms. Therefore, the wise one should worship the supreme form, indeed, without parts.


The one whose intellect is firmly attached to the gross form is incapable. By worshiping that without reason, he indeed attains the ultimate unsurpassed good. Otherwise, his path would not reach anywhere, even in millions of births.
Chapter 8
Thus, having heard the beloved's words and understood the essence of the great lord, Hemachooda determined that Tripura is made of consciousness by Hemalekha's words.


With a calmed mind, having known Tripura, the great goddess endowed with supreme powers, from the teachers, he realized her supreme qualities.


Following her single-mindedly, Hemachooda became firmly devoted, and thus, by worshiping her, some months passed.


Tripura, the supreme goddess, bestowed grace in his heart. His mind turned away from objects and became deeply contemplative.


This much is rare in the world without the grace of others: a mind inclined to contemplation, which is the principal cause of liberation.


O Rama, until a deeply contemplative mind is born, the ultimate good is not attained by hundreds of means anywhere.


Then, again, on some day, he was together in private with his beloved, with a deeply contemplative mind.


Seeing him coming to her place from a distance, she rose, brought him in, and seated him on her seat.


By washing his feet with respect and worshiping him according to the rule, she spoke supreme words, beautiful with the flow of nectar.


Beloved, today I see you after a long time. Indeed, is your body free from disease, was it disease-prone?


Tell me the events, since I was not remembered by you. Indeed, without seeing me or speaking to me.


Not even a part of the day passed like this earlier. How did this happen? I think you are displeased with me, not on the right path.


In a dream or elsewhere also, how did this happen? Tell me, how did you spend a night, even one, which felt like an age before?


Without me, even one moment felt like an age, very hard to bear. Saying this, she embraced him and appeared distressed for a moment, then.


He also, embraced by his beloved, did not show even slight discomfort. He said, dear, you should not confuse me like this.


I have known you firmly; there is no cause of sorrow for you. You, knower of the ultimate, wise, how could delusion touch you?


I have come to truly ask you something; listen to what I will say. Tell me clearly about the events you mentioned before.


Who is that mother of yours mentioned, or your friend, and who is her husband? Who are her children, and also, are they mine or yours? Where are they?


That is not well known to me, nor do I think it is falsely spoken. But it is spoken by you completely by implying something.


Analyze that and explain it so that I will clearly know. I am devoted to you, remove my doubt in the heart.


Thus addressed, Hemalekha, with clear eyes and a pure mind, thought about the divine grace endowed.


Indeed, he is very detached from sense objects due to great fortitude, struck by the power of Lord Mahesha, fruitful due to the accumulation of merit.


It is time for awakening, and therefore I will enlighten him. O lord, your great fortune is indeed obtained due to the grace of the Lord.


Otherwise, one does not see disinterest in sense objects anywhere. This characteristic is known from the beginning as the grace of the Lord.


Behold, I will explain to you the conduct stated by the wise, the mind's disinterest in enjoyment and inclination towards contemplation.


The supreme consciousness is my mother, intellect is considered my friend, and ignorance is indeed called unreal, by which the intellect is well-associated.


The power of ignorance is clearly seen in the world, as it makes a rope appear like a snake and causes great fear.


The great delusion is its son, the mind is its son, its wife is imagination, and their five sons are the sensory organs.


The five sensory organs are their place, and perception of objects is the impression of the mind.


That enjoyment is dream enjoyment, the sister of imagination. His other wife is great consumer desire, and her two sons are anger and greed.


Anger and greed are said to be their city, which is the body. My great mantra is indeed the self-revelation.


Breath is called Pracara and is the dear friend of the mind. Forests and others are described as hells. Thus, everything is described.


The union of intellect with me is called concentration. The attainment of my mother's world is stated as liberation, dear.


Thus, I have described my own story. Yours is also similar, indeed. Understanding this well with reasoning, attain the supreme welfare.
Chapter 9
Having heard his beloved's words, Hemachuda was very astonished and, with a voice choked with joy, began to speak again.


Oh dear, you are blessed and skillful. What can I describe of your splendor of knowledge, which has been spoken in the form of a complete story?


Such a story of my nature was not known to me anywhere. By your words, I now see it as clearly as a fruit in hand.


I remember and experience it within, oh, the wonderful actions of the world. Who is that supreme consciousness, the mother, and how is our birth from her?


Who are we, and what is our nature? Tell me that. Thus asked, Hemalekha, Ram said to the beloved.


Listen, lord, I will explain this hidden meaning with respect. Contemplate the form of the self with an extremely pure intellect.


Not visible nor speakable, therefore I will say how. Knowing your own self-form, indeed, then you will know the mother.


Indeed, there is no command in one’s true form, therefore it is without a commander, see your own form with your self and pure intellect.


Shining from gods to lower beings, illuminated by rays, shining everywhere, of everything, always without mind.


How, where, when, by whom can it be described even partially? Show my eyes, thus it is said, beloved, now.


Here, a teacher is of no use as in seeing eyes. Even a skilled great teacher, how can he show the eyes?


Therefore, the teacher is a means here in showing that. I will tell you that means; listen with a restrained mind.


As long as you see "mine" in the self, then beyond that, your own form, which is not "mine," does not shine to you.


Going to solitude, discerning this, whatever shines as mine, abandoning that, beyond that, observe the self.


As I shine to you as mine, not because of self-ness in me. But, by mere relation, my own thinking, not in essence, indeed, I am.


Abandoning all for my sake, which indeed cannot be abandoned, realizing that self, attain supreme welfare.


Thus spoken by his beloved, Hemachuda, standing quickly, went, mounting a horse, out from the city at that moment.


Entering a garden like Nandan for a moment, he entered a tall crystal mansion at the forest's end.


Dismissing all attendants and ordering the gatekeepers, no one should enter here during my solitary contemplation.


The king's ministers, teachers, or the king himself, even if assembled here, are not allowed to enter until I give you the order.


Thus, having spoken, he ascended the mansion and entered the ninth floor. There, at a beautiful window viewing all worlds.


He sat on a soft cushioned seat, free from others, and then, concentrating his mind firmly, he engaged in contemplation.


Surely, how are all these people thus deluded? Not even one here knows their own self even slightly, indeed.


All people perform various activities for their own self. Some read scriptures and Vedic texts daily.


Some earn wealth, some rule the earth. Others fight with enemies, and some indulge solely in enjoyments.


They do this for self-interest, but which of these is the self? No one here knows this; whence, thus, this delusion?


Alas, truly without knowing the self, indeed, all this was done. Like actions done in vain in a dream, now I contemplate that.


House and grain, kingdom and wealth, women and cattle, something else, are not my essence, but due to the absence of "I-ness".


For my sake, due to being, I should indeed be the body in every way. Surely, I am a Kshatriya heir with a fair body, no doubt.


With "I-ness" overcome, thus, these people also, others, thus determining, the prince contemplated that body.


Then he began to negate the selfhood of the body. Alas, how is this body the refuge of possessiveness?


The aggregate of blood, bones, etc., constantly changing, may surely be just my form. This severed, indeed, is observed.


Like wood or clay, otherwise established in dreams, I am not the body; I may indeed be another. This life-breath is also likewise.


Mind and intellect, I may not be, since these are mine. Thus, from body to intellect, indeed another I am, no doubt.


I am never not there, due to the absence of appearance. Always, I am indeed established as appearing, no doubt.


Clearly, what is the awareness of my appearing? I do not know that; why is this not known by me?


The pot and so on appear by the eyes and so on, not otherwise on earth. This life-breath shines by touch; the mind is perceived by knowledge.


Thus, by what is my awareness of the intellect not known, indeed, this? Thus, if the self does not shine from where is their awareness known to me?


Then, I will not contemplate these (mind & intellect); then my awareness will arise. Thus determining, by mind, he abandoned the mental sphere.


Then he saw dense darkness for a moment. This is the form of my self, thus determining, in his mind.


He obtained incomparable joy and then thought again, "Surely, I will see again." Thus, he restrained his mind.


By forceful practice, he restrained the restless mind and saw clearly a mass of light, without beginning or end, shining for a moment.


Awakened, he thought, "What is this?" Amazed, he said, "Oh, I see various forms. What is this self, and how is this?"


Then, he restrained his mind again, saying, "I will see again." His mind, absorbed in sleep, appeared firm for a long time.


There, he saw a network of dreams, various strange visions. Then, greatly awakened, he attained deep thought.


What dreams did I see covered by sleep? Oh, I saw darkness and light; the self may be of dream nature.


The dream is indeed a mental delight; how can I abandon this? So, firmly determining, I will restrain and see again.


He restrained his mind forcefully, and it became steady. Then, he became as if immersed in the ocean of bliss within.


By the movement of the mind again, he immediately awakened. What was this? Was it my dream or mental confusion?


Or, is this indeed the truth, it appears inconceivable to me. I did not experience any bliss like this; how did I obtain it?


Oh, nothing here is equal to even a fragment of this bliss. I was deluded like in deep sleep; how did this bliss remain?


I do not perceive any cause here; how can that be? Even though I endeavored for self-realization, till today, I did not know.


I see the self, another, and another; what can this be? Is it light or darkness, bliss or something else?


This self may be mine, and this form sequentially so. I do not reach the end conclusion here; I will ask my wise, dear one again.


Thus determining, the prince called the doorkeeper and instructed him to bring Hemalekha to his presence.


Then, she arrived in a moment by the doorkeeper's order and ascended the great mansion like moonlight on Mount Meru.


Then she saw the prince, her dear one, tranquil-minded, steady, unchanging, with senses withdrawn.


Approaching near, he quickly ascended her seat and she sat on the same seat in a moment.


Opening his eyes, he saw her standing by his side. Seeing his dear one, he quickly embraced her with affection.


Then his dear one spoke beautiful, nectar-flowing words, "My lord, why have you called me? Is your body healthy?"


Tell me the reason you called me, for which I have come. Thus asked by his dear one, he spoke to her about himself.


Dear, as instructed by you, I have settled here in solitude, deeply contemplating the nature and characteristics of the self.


Even further, it is strange that it is observed as separate, why is that? The self is always present and manifest.


Incorrect perception arises due to the cause of other perceptions. Considering this, I stopped other perceptions and became well-settled.


I saw darkness and another light, sometimes obtaining great bliss. What is this? Tell me, dear.


Is this indeed the form of the self, or may it be another? Properly discerning, tell me how I can observe it.


Thus addressed, Hemalekha, the knower of the ultimate, said: "Listen, dear, I will tell you all with a concentrated mind."


The effort you undertook in external suppression is auspicious, approved by all, especially by self-knowers.


Without that, no one has obtained it anywhere or anytime. But that does not become a cause due to being always obtained.


In non-attainment of self, selfhood cannot be; in selfhood, how can there be non-attainment? The self is unattainable in all ways; its attainment does not exist.


For the unattained, there may be attainment, but not for the self; therefore, its suppression is not for the purpose of attainment. Here, see an example.


Something covered by darkness is obtained due to its suppression by lamps, as if it were attained in the world, it is just like that.


Just as someone with a confused mind, having forgotten an ornament somewhere, by suppressing other thoughts, with concentration, again.


Obtains that lost ornament, just as it is attained. Suppression is not the cause here, but in the attainment of the ornament, as it is so.


In the attainment of the self, suppression of external objects is not the cause. The self has not been perceived by you still, there due to lack of comprehension.


Just as an unlearned person, going to the royal assembly at night, sees the courtiers and lamps, but does not know the illuminator.


Listen, dear, at the end of suppression, darkness is seen. At the beginning of seeing darkness, there your remaining state is established.


Contemplate that state always, giving supreme bliss. Here, all are seized by the great delusion of outward-seeing.


Searching and searching, obstructed, they did not attain that state. In the world, there are scholars, skilled and good logicians.


Not knowing that state, they grieve day and night. By mere word-craft, that state is not attained.


As long as a learned person searches or contemplates, it is not attained because it is not graspable.


Having gone far, it is not attainable, but by staying, it is always attained. It is not knowable by contemplation; it shines without contemplation.


Running like trying to catch one's shadow on the head, it is not attainable by action anywhere, just as in a clean mirror, thousands of reflections are seen.


Even a child sees but does not see the mirror; thus, indeed, a person sees the reflection of the world in the great mirror of the self.


One does not know the self due to lack of understanding, just as one familiar with the sky sees the sky but does not realize it.


The world does not realize the sky; similarly, it does not realize the nature of the self. Lord, with subtle vision, see the world as of the nature of knowledge and the known.


There, knowledge is self-established; in its absence, nothing exists. It is the measure of all means of knowledge and is self-established.


Since it is independent of means of knowledge, self-established from the beginning, therefore, it is not attained by the means of attainment, ever.


There, for the confused, there is no question nor answer. That great mirror is not to be denied.


There, all shines indeed like the reflection in a mirror. Limitation by space or even by time does not exist.


Due to shining within, how can there be limitation by them? The appearance of limitation is like objects in the sky.


Prince, with subtle vision, observe your own self where this world shines in the universal consciousness.


By the perfection of absorption in that, one attains all-doership. I will tell you the realization from which you attain that state.


Observe with subtle intellect the middle part between sleep and waking, between the states of consciousness, and between consciousness and the known.


This state is one's own form, which, upon attaining, one does not become deluded. The world continues like this by mere ignorance of this.


Here, there is no form, taste, smell, touch, or sound. There is no sorrow or happiness, nothing to be grasped and no grasper.


This is the lord of all, supporting all, in all forms yet devoid of all, the sustainer, Vishnu, Ishvara, and Sadashiva.


See, restraining slightly within the self by the self, giving up external expansion, striving for inner expansion.


Giving up the thought "I see," like a blind person with a steady mind, giving up seeing and not seeing, realize quickly who you are.


Thus spoken by his beloved, Hemachuda, realizing that state, attaining long rest, went forgetting the outward world.
Chapter 10
Then Hemalekha saw that her beloved, having attained the supreme state, did not move from it for a moment.


Awakened, he opened his eyes and saw the beloved world, desiring again to rest in that state with great speed.


As he closed his eyes, she spoke, taking her beloved's hand, speaking sweetly.


Lord, what was your intention? Tell me what happened to you from closing or opening your eyes. Consider your gain or loss.


Opening the eyes, what is not attained? And what is attained by closing them? Tell me, beloved, I wish to hear your state.


Thus asked by her, he spoke like an intoxicated person, lazy, unwilling to speak, weighed down by laziness.


Beloved, I have indeed attained utmost rest after a long time. There is no rest for me in the external world, full of sorrow.


Enough of external efforts and contemplations. Blinded by misfortune, I did not know the true happiness of the self until now.


As someone wandering for alms does not know his home, similarly, I did not know the ocean of my own happiness again and again.


Thinking the best sensory happiness is filled with a mass of sorrows and as fleeting as lightning, I sought stability due to attachment to it.


Surely afflicted by sorrows, I did not attain rest. Alas, people are devoid of the discrimination between sorrow and happiness.


Seekers of happiness always foolishly gather a collection of sorrows. Enough of that self-acquired sorrowful experience.


Beloved, have mercy on me, I request with folded hands. I wish for long rest in myself, in the blissful self.


Alas, struck by fate, you appear to be, even knowing this state, but still abandoning that, you foolishly strive for sorrow.


Thus spoken, she, slightly smiling, spoke to her beloved, "Lord, that supremely pure state is not known to you."


Where the wise and pure-hearted do not delude, that state is far for you, like the sky to one on the ground.


By you, something may be known, but it is unknown. Closing or opening the eyes, that state is not seen.


Without doing or doing, it is not attained ever. Without going and even going, one does not reach that state.


How can the full state be attained by closing, doing, or going, measured by the opening of an eyelash?


If hidden within, then the state would indeed be always full. Oh, your grandeur of delusion is a wonder, what can I say?


In which crores of universes are positioned at different angles, that is hidden by the opening of an eyelash's width of a finger?


Listen, prince, I will tell you the essence of truth. Until all the knots are broken, one does not attain happiness.


There are crores of knots turned into ropes of delusion. The lack of self-awareness is said to be the rope of delusion.


Where those knots of perverted understanding are, there is the first certainty of inquiry into selfhood in the body.


Under whose control this world spreads out and it is difficult to resist it, so in the world, the understanding of non-self is supported by perception.


Thus, the certainties of separation between the soul and God are considered knots. This has arisen for long and is again reformed.


The person entangled in the form of knots is bound. From that, by the loosening of those knots, liberation from bondage is declared.


Which, closing your eyes, you sufficiently attain your state, that state is your own form, pure and supreme consciousness.


That itself is the great mirror surface of the entire world. When, where, and by what form is it not? Explain that to me.


When one says your consciousness is of any form, then indeed limited to that time and place, it is like the son of a barren woman.


As a reflection doesn’t exist without a mirror, similarly, O lord, renouncing that state, there is nothing anywhere.


By opening your eyes, what would it hide? As long as you understand this, the knot is still firm.


As long as that state is not attained, what is attained is not that. By closing or opening the eyes, what you think is attained is not that state.


Therefore, that which is complete and undivided, due to limitation, by actions, indeed — where is that protector not there, O Lord, like the dazzling radiance of the fire of time?


It makes one's own self known with great imagination, the accumulation of fuel. Knowing the supreme state, there remains no duty for you.


Abandon the knot, controlling, "I see," established in the heart. Uproot the supreme, firm knot, "This is not I."


See everywhere the self filled with unbroken bliss. See in the self the entire world like a reflection in a mirror.


Not contemplating again, approach the remaining within, then seeing the entire self everywhere, be at peace with your own self.


Thus, hearing the words spoken by his beloved, Hemachuda, pure-hearted, knowing his complete self everywhere, he became free from delusion.


Gradually, by attaining complete immersion and steady contemplation, he always remained, roaming with Hemalekha and groups of young women.


Ruling his prosperous kingdom, having conquered enemies in battle, making others hear scriptures, hearing them, and earning wealth.


By performing Ashvamedha, Rajasuya, and other major sacrifices, remaining on earth for twenty thousand years as a liberated soul.


Observing his son established in the state of liberation while living, the king, along with Muktachuda and his brother Manichuda, also thought.


Why does he not appear here as before at all, neither rejoicing extremely in happiness nor disturbed in sorrow?


Why does he see gain and loss, enemy and friend with equanimity, performing royal duties like an actor on the stage?


He always appears intoxicated like a drinker of intoxicating beverage, always elsewhere in mind, sufficiently performing duties as if.


For what reason, and thus approaching him in private somewhere, they asked Hemachuda, "Why are you thus?"


Then, Hemachuda gradually explained his state to them, enlightening both his brother and father.


Having attained the supreme truth, they became liberated while living. Then, hearing this, the group of ministers also understood the world's condition.


Considering the nature of their own self, they became knowers of the knowable. Thus, in the city of Vishala, gradually, indeed, mutually.


From instruction, all knew the truth, from children to cowherds, men, women, young and old, male and female servants also.


Knowing the knowable, having abandoned body-consciousness, they became indeed without desire, anger, or greed.


Be it a child or an elder, without being knowledgeable, somewhere one exhibits, by anger, desire, and others, engaged in worldly affairs.


Mother plays with the child, talking about the supreme truth. Male and female servants always serve their master similarly indeed.


Conversing about the supreme truth with words, actors perform drama with characters related to truth.


Singers sing words focused on the news of discernment. Jesters always criticize worldly affairs.


Scholars indeed teach scriptures to students and people with examples suitable for the consideration of the supreme truth.


Thus, there, men and women, male and female servants, actors, jesters, attendants, soldiers, ministers, artisans, and courtesans.


All of them became knowers of the knowable in the city of Vishala, engaged in worldly affairs by the strength of previous impressions.


Does not remember the past, good or bad, nor contemplates the future, as causes of joy, sorrow, etc.


In the present, smiling, rejoicing, grieving, getting angry, always a person extremely engaged in worldly affairs, like one intoxicated with honey.


Such was that city which sages like Sanaka called the famous city of knowledge upon arriving.


Where even caged parrots continuously say, "Worship your own self in the form of consciousness."


There is nothing known apart from consciousness, like the reflection in a mirror. Consciousness is the known, I am consciousness, and everything, both moving and non-moving, is consciousness.


Because everything shines following consciousness, which is independent, therefore, people worship consciousness that illuminates and supports all.


Worship pure consciousness, abandoning illusion, with clear vision. Even animals, extremely, in such a place, speak these words.


Even today, that place is called the famous city of knowledge. There, formerly, Hemalekha indeed enlightened (them).


Hemachuda became wise and liberated while living, and others, including women, children, and others, all became knowers of the highest and lowest truths.


Therefore, the source of well-being is indeed association with the wise, and in desiring well-being, one should first take refuge in the wise.
Chapter 11
Having heard the very wonderful story of Hemachuda, Bhargava, with a doubtful mind, began to ask.


O revered teacher, the knowledge you have spoken is very wonderful, but it appears to me to be difficult and unattainable in every way.


How is this visible world of the nature of pure consciousness? It is unseen, and indeed, this can only be accepted by faith, not otherwise.


Consciousness, being free from objects, is not perceivable in any way. This is not feasible in any way. How can the mind ascend to this?


With kindness, I should be completely enlightened in this matter. Thus asked, Guru Dattatreya said to Bhargava.


Listen, O Rama, I will explain the nature of the visible as it is. This visible world is entirely pure vision and not otherwise.


Here, I will explain the rationale. Listen attentively and focused. This visible world is the effect, perceptible from the cause.


Creation is a new appearance every moment. This world shines with newness, emerging every moment.


Some say this world arises in a single moment, while others say it is an aggregate of elements, composed of moving and unmoving.


It is ascertained that in every way, the world arises. Therefore, the theory of nature is not appropriate due to excessive implications.


By consistency and contradiction, the determination of cause and effect, and the coherence of activities, how can it be accidental?


Sometimes, even if the cause is unseen, an unseen cause should be assumed. Conformity to this is indeed justifiable, as stated by all.


Repeatedly, an effect seen with a cause should be assumed to have a cause even when not seen, otherwise, universal experience would be contradicted.


Activity would be contradicted; therefore, everything has a cause. Thus, for every effect, there is some cause.


Everywhere the world is seen; therefore, there is nothing without cause. Some say the effect is produced by unreal atoms.


For them, it would be extremely different, even absolutely non-existent. Unity of non-existence and existence is indeed contradictory and cannot be.


Indeed, drunk and not drunk, light and darkness, cannot be one due to contradiction and resulting confusion.


Even due to the will of the Lord, how could the origin of the first action arise? The world being of the nature of equilibrium of qualities is impossible.


This world appears due to being a cause of inequality and deficiency in the cause of equality, by intelligence without basis, and due to lack of evidence.


Therefore, the cause of the world's activity is not perceived. The unseen has the basis in scripture, not other consideration.


Due to the imperfection of the perceivers and the instability of the means of knowledge, the separation of the effect and the doer is repeatedly observed.


This world, having a doer, indeed, he is conscious. How can the doer of an unimaginable form be common?


Therefore, he is of unimaginable power, the scripture is his reflection. The means of knowledge of the complete is indeed uninterrupted and superior in all respects.


There, indeed, one Lord Shiva is described in the past as independent, without a material cause, due to the grandeur of independence.


On his own foundation, the world picture is revealed for play, as imagined alone in the kingdom of dreams.


With the sense of 'I', one grasps the body, likewise the world. Your form is not as the body, due to the distinction in dreams.


Likewise, his world body does not dissolve in distinction. Indeed, you are separate from the body, etc., as pure consciousness.


Thus, the deity with the single form of the void and consciousness, immutable, by him, this world picture is revealed in oneself.


Where could one reveal the world picture, except in one's own, where is it possible for another to reveal it? What can exist at any time except consciousness?


Where one says the absence of consciousness, that place indeed does not exist. The absence of consciousness is not proven by anything, therefore, consciousness is supreme.


The great existence, devouring the world, complete, appears like waves without the ocean, or light without the sun.


As the world does not exist without consciousness, therefore, this great god has the form of pure consciousness.


Before creation, from him was born, there it is sustained, in him it dissolves in the end, this world of moving and non-moving.


Thus, the well-known meaning in scripture is not contradicted. In unseen matters, agreement is the evidence in scripture.


Because the powers of jewels, mantras, etc., are seen everywhere, one of limited understanding does not comprehend the great result of jewels, mantras.


Therefore, the scripture spoken by the omniscient, all-seeing, mentions the god indeed situated in the beginning of creation.


Without a material cause, indeed, in the beginning, he created the entire world because the great god is endowed with complete, pure independence.


On the foundation of consciousness, the entire world picture is revealed. That world does not exist anywhere outside.


Due to the completeness of the lord, there is no other place here. That which is situated in another place is not proven by any means.


Likewise, just as a reflection on the mirror surface, the world is revealed in the deity, thus everything is consistent.


At the beginning of the world, indeed, the actions of the god resemble a yogi's, and creation is considered as resembling a city of imagination by the god.


O Rama, your mental creation is only mind-made, full of many measures and measurables, indeed, it appears.


Although differentiated into many forms, there is nothing other than the mind; whatever arises from the mind remains there and merges there.


That, being purely mental, as likewise the world from Shiva; Shiva is of the form of pure consciousness, consciousness without form.


Embodied with the unity of infinite powers of Tripura, witnessing all, that consciousness is entirely complete, devoid of division.


Time and space in this world are remembered as causing division; there, space is formed of shapes, but time is formed of actions.


Tell me, how would form or action, based on that consciousness, cause divisibility?


Tell me, in which place and time does consciousness not exist here? Where there is no consciousness, how would that be indeed?


Indeed, the existence of objects is not another illumination. Illumination is said to be consciousness, not of non-consciousness.


But illumination would be supreme, which independently illuminates. The insentient are not self-illuminating, indeed, they are by the illumination of consciousness.


Indeed, consciousness illuminates in itself without depending on others. The insentient illuminate relying on consciousness, and not otherwise.


Listen, if even in non-illumination, objects exist, then in this world, the condition of existing and not existing would not make sense.


Therefore, the existence of objects in the world is the illumination of consciousness, and not another, just as the existence of reflections is in the mirror only, indeed.


Thus, consciousness is the existence of the world, therefore, everything becomes consciousness, and what shines more is purity, not impurity.


Based on the degree of hardness and purity of reflecting surface, the reflection appears, as either clear or unclear.


In the mirror and water also, this is observed clearly; due to the insentience of the mirror, they lack independence.


Reflection's dependence is due to consciousness' pure independence and non-dependence; purity is inherently established in consciousness, from the absence of impurity.


Impurity would be of diverse qualities, but consciousness is not diverse; from the nature of unity, the power of consciousness, and from indivisibility in all ways.


From the nature of non-empty self, purity in self is superior in all ways; the appearance of non-self, is illumination by its connection to others.


Those who know the nature of reflections declare the reflection; that the world is like this, it is observed by all.


By itself, it does not shine anywhere, but shines by the support of consciousness. Therefore, the world is like a well-measured reflection in a mirror.


Consciousness, even when colored by varied other states, illuminates without deviating even slightly from its nature, like a mirror.


As the reflections in the mirror are not different from the mirror, so are the reflections in consciousness not different from consciousness.


The reflection in the mirror is indeed established as the cause of the image; consciousness may be the cause of its independence, just as the reflection is indeed of the world.


O Rama, see all the states reflected in oneself by self-will, appearing without cause, without any original image.


Will is indeed declared as the independence of consciousness; in the state without will, that consciousness is of pure single form.


Thus, from the pure single form of consciousness, before creation, there was great independence, indeed of the nature of will.


From that, this reflection-like world manifests; from the stability of great will, this shines for long.


The common world shines from the cause of full independence; for others, due to their incompleteness, it shines with an uncommon nature.


By repeated practice, with jewels, mantras, etc., as much as one leaves constraints in oneself, thus indeed, there is illumination.


See, O Rama, the magician, illuminating the world-picture without using materials, indeed, everywhere by will.


The common, stable world, suitable for one's purposes, again indeed, one withdraws this into oneself; thus, the world shines.


See, the yogis perceive that creation as enveloped in full stability; but other than yogis consider the external creation with their own limitation.


Having only a mental body, enter the mountain with me. Thus addressed, the king, unable to leave the body, said.


O sage, how shall I leave this body? Explain. If I leave it by force, I will completely come to destruction.


Thus speaking, the sage's son smiled and said to the king, Oh, you are ignorant  of yoga. Let it be, close your eyes.


Having spoken thus, with closed eyes, he entered the king in a moment, pulling his subtle body and throwing the physical body into a pit.


The mirror is indeed immovable there, but the reflection is moving; similarly, the world is moving, while consciousness is immovable and all-encompassing.


Therefore, the states have the nature of one considering them; like, the sunlight indeed is the illuminator of objects.


For owls and others are blind during the day, it is opposite, like darkness; illumination and darkness are not clearly distinct for them.


Thus, poison may be poison for some and non-poison for others. For humans and others, nature is observed with fear and is harmful.


For yogis and celestial beings, the nature is non-harmful. Time and place, which seem long to humans and others, are influenced differently too.


It is indeed the opposite for gods and yogis, just as the distance appearing in the mirror seems different from the actual distance.


Similarly, its nature is not stable in consideration. Therefore, nothing exists without support.


What exists and shines is indeed only consciousness, the great goddess. Thus, the world is rightly said to be of the nature of one consciousness.

O sage, how shall I leave this body? Explain. If I leave it by force, I will completely come to destruction.


Thus speaking, the sage's son smiled and said to the king, Oh, you are ignorant  of yoga. Indeed, be it so, close your eyes.


Having said this, with closed eyes, entering the king in a moment, pulling his subtle body and throwing the physical body into a pit.


By the power of yoga, entering the mountain with the king, being asleep due to the body's absence, only with the mind-created body.


Placing and awakening, the king then saw himself taken by the sage in the great sky.


Seeing upward and all around the fearful, infinite sky, afraid, he said to the sage's son, "O sage, do not leave me."


I will perish if abandoned; I will fall without support. Seeing the frightened king, the sage's son smiled and said:


Abandon your fear, O king; I will not leave you. Observe this inner mountain world with courage.


Then, taking courage, the king observed below at a distance, the sky with stars, covered in deep darkness.


Entering that place, he then observed below, the vast moon's orbit. Coming there, he was immobilized.


Protected by the coolness of the moon's orbit and the sage's son, he then reached the sun's world, heated by its rays.


Cooled by the sage's son through yoga, he observed the entire world, like a reflection of the heavenly world.


Then, standing on the peak of the golden mountain with the sage, the king observed all shown by the sage.


Blessed with divine sight by the sage to see distant places, he observed the circular mountain named Lokāloka.


Outside it, masses of darkness; inside, a golden land with oceans, seven islands, filled with rivers and mountains.


He observed all worlds, starting with Indra, the best of the wise, demons, humans, Rakshasas, Yakshas, Kinnaras, and others.


There, he observed in Satya-loka, in Vaikuntha, in the silver mountain, the sage's son and himself as Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva.


Divided, existing for the creation of all worlds, then he observed in the division of the earth, having made different forms, likewise.


Dedicated to the administration of the earth, assuming universal sovereignty, thus seeing the supreme power of yoga of the sage's son.


Mahasena was astonished and then the sage's son said, "O king, while you were seeing this world creation, time has passed."


"Twelve crores of days have passed there also; let us go to the outer world where my father resides."


Thus saying, the king rose into the sky with him again, emerging from that mountain as before, and reached the outside.
Chapter 13
The sage's son, again at the exit from the mountain, made Mahasena unconscious with the subtle body consisting of impressions.


Taking him out, he placed him into that body and revived him, fitting him well into the worn-out body.


Then, Mahasena, risen, observed the external world, the land, people, trees, streams, and ponds, all new.


Greatly astonished, he asked the sage's son, "Which world is this, O great one, that you have shown to me?"


"Explain this unprecedented, wonderful world," asked Mahasena. The sage's son said to him:


"Listen, O king, this world, which we inhabited before, has indeed undergone a transformation over a long time."


"One day in the mountain world, for us, indeed, here corresponds to twelve crores of years in time."


"Thus, this world has passed and attained a different form. See the different customs and languages everywhere."


"In the same way, people's conditions change with time. Thus, I have seen many different world conditions."


"See, this is my revered father with a composed mind. This is the place where you praised my father before."


"See this great mountain where my world is observed. Thousands of your brother's subjects have passed away."


"The city named Sundara in Vanga country, which was yours before, has now become a forest filled with wild beasts."


"Your brother's descendant, known as Virabahu, is immediately the king of Malwa, in the city named Vishala on the banks of Kshipra."


"Your descendant named Susharma became a king in Dravida, in the city named Vardhana on the banks of the Tamraparni river."


"The condition of this world always changes thus, and in a short time, it became this new world."


"From now, in a long time, mountains, rivers, ponds, lands will change; thus indeed is the world condition."


"Mountains go lower, lowlands become high; desert lands become wetlands, mountains become sandy."


"Hard earth, mostly rocky, becomes very soft; soft earth also becomes like stone sometimes."


"Barren land becomes fertile, fertile land becomes barren; gems become gravel, and gravel has the essence of gems."


"Saline water becomes sweet, sweet water becomes saline; sometimes there is an abundance of people, sometimes an abundance of animals."


"Sometimes, the world is seen abundant with worms and insects. Thus, this world changes differently due to differences in time."


"Therefore, this world was indeed such as ours before." Thus, hearing the words of the sage's son, the king...


Mahasena, overwhelmed with extreme sorrow, fainted. Consoled by the sage's son, the king attained wisdom.


Overwhelmed with extreme sorrow, he lamented like a very miserable person, for his brother, brother's sons, and his own wives.


Remembering his sons and others separately, he lamented extremely sorrowfully. Then, as he was lamenting for his brother and others from delusion, immediately...


The sage's son, with the intention of enlightening the king, said, "O king, you are indeed intelligent. Whom and why do you lament?"


"Intelligent ones indeed never do fruitless actions. Whoever does actions without considering the result is foolish."


"Why do you lament the truth? Tell me, for what reason indeed is your lamentation?" Thus addressed, the extremely sorrowful king Mahasena said to him:


"Why do you not see the place of my sorrow, O great sage? Why do you ask the reason for the one whose all is destroyed?"


"Even in one person's destruction, there would be sorrow altogether for the world. Why do you ask again when total destruction is present?"


Thus addressed, the sage's son also said again, as if smiling, "O king, tell me, what is this eternal family duty of yours?"


"If not lamenting would result in great sin, or otherwise, if the lost is obtained again by lamenting, then..."


"O king, consider with courage, what result would come from lamenting? If lost relatives should be lamented, then listen..."


"Past relatives, lost, including ancestors and others, indeed should always be lamented. Why were they not lamented previously?"


"Then, whose are your relatives, and where is your relationship with them? They are like worms in the excrement of your mother, father, or oneself, indeed."


"Countless worms born from one's body and connected to it are not considered your relatives. Why and where are they not lamented?"


"O king, consider who you are, and whom you lament as lost. Are you the body, separate from the body, or the body in conglomerate form?"


"The destruction of one part of a conglomerate is called destruction. Every moment, the body undergoes part-by-part destruction."


"The decline of urine, excretion, mucus, nails, hair, etc., continually occurs. Indeed, the complete destruction of the conglomerate is not observed."


"A part of your brother's body is clearly in the elements like earth, etc. Ultimately, the body-space is only indestructible."


"You are not the body, but the possessor of the body. Just as you say 'my body,' similarly, how can you be the body?"


"If you are separate from the body, what connection do you have with other bodies? Just as there is no relationship with the garments of brothers."


"How can you lament the destroyed bodies due to non-difference? My body, my senses, my life, my mind, thus you are."


"O king, tell me your true essence," he said to Mahasena. Addressed thus, Mahasena deeply reflected for a moment.


Unable to answer the sage's question, very distressed, Mahasena said, "O lord, I do not know who I am completely."


"Naturally, I lament without knowing the reason. I have surrendered to you, O lord, distressed. Tell me what this is."


"All lament for any dead relative. They do not know their self and certainly do not lament for others."


"O lord, tell this clearly to your disciple," Mahasena asked. Then the sage's son spoke to Mahasena.


"O king, listen. Deluded by Mahadevi's illusion, people always lament uselessly without knowing their self."


"Until the true essence of the self is known, people certainly lament. Knowing it, they do not lament anywhere again."


"Just as oneself deluded by sleep laments without knowing itself, a man deluded by a magician's spell laments by illusion."


"Just as one laments by the fear of a snake created by illusion, thus, deluded by illusion, one laments without knowing oneself."


"Just as one awakened from a dream or knowing a magician's spell does not lament anywhere and laughs at others in grief."


"Thus, knowers of the self, freed from illusion, do not lament anywhere and laugh at those like you deluded by illusion."


"Knowing the true essence of the self, crossing the difficult illusion, destroy grief arising from delusion through true reflection, O mighty-armed one."


Thus addressed, Mahasena again said to the sage, "O lord, the example you stated is indeed difficult."


"The dream or illusory world appears to have a void nature, but this waking world is real and fulfills all purposes."


"How can the uncontradicted and stable waking world be like a dream?" Thus addressed, the very wise sage's son again explained.


"Listen, O king, to what you stated, that the example is difficult. This is your second delusion, like a dream within a dream."


"Does not even a dream tree at that time provide benefit to travelers and remove their heat by providing shade?"


"Does the dream satisfy the dream and mortal beings by fruits and others? Where is the obstruction in the dream, and how is it observed as stable?"


"If you say the entire dream is obstructed in the waking state, listen: is not the entire waking world obstructed in deep sleep?"


"If you say it is not obstructed the next day due to continuation, then where is the continuation of the dream the next day?"


"If you say there is no continuation in the dream, O king, listen: where is the appearance of continuation in the new experience in waking?"


"If you say the continuation appears elsewhere in the new experience, listen: thus, in the dream, too, the continuation appears indeed in the stable appearance."


"If you say there is false continuation in the dream, thus, in waking, too, it is so. Consider with a subtle intellect that thing established in waking."


"The body, tree, river, lamp, and so on are momentarily different. How can that continuation indeed be of true essence?"


"Even immovable things are not connected to the next moment; their form is always fragmented by streams."


"Mountains are always fragmented by mice, insects, boars, streams, and others from all sides."


"Mountains, oceans, and the earth even are momentarily changing. Now I will explain to you; observe with a subtle intellect, O king."


"The limited continuation in dreams and waking is indeed the same, while the unlimited continuation in actions is extremely rare."


"Continuation always exists by cause and form. If so, the cause is certainly consisting of earth and others."


"That continuation is also observed in the dream due to the appearance of earth and others. Now, the obstruction of the dream is experienced in waking."


"The obstruction of waking does not appear to anyone anywhere. If so, listen, I will explain: obstruction is indeed non-appearance."


"In deep sleep, the non-appearance of the entire world is experienced. Now, if obstruction is indeed the absence of perception, then listen."


"The absence of perception does not exist for the deluded like you, indeed. For those who know the truth, the absence of perception is clear."


"Therefore , this network of perceptions is in the same state as dream perception. A long duration appears in the dream without distinction."


"Therefore, the unobstructed, functioning, and stable dream state is similar to the waking state in every way."


"As the waking state is clearly grasped in waking, the waking state is also grasped in the dream like that."


"Thus established, where is the distinction, O king, between dream and waking? Then, why do you not grieve for your own relatives in the dream?"


"In this world, reality is established by mere thought. By thinking of emptiness, it also becomes emptiness without resistance."


"Indeed, thought stabilized by the absence of validation becomes the truth by its own nature, O king."


"Indeed, if you have seen my world as an example here, after circumambulating this mountain, come, and we shall see it now."


Thus having said, he took the king by hand and circumambulated the mountain, arriving there together with the king.


Again, the wise son of the sage spoke to Mahasena: "O king, see this mountain extending a couple of miles."


"Indeed, seen in its womb, your world is widely and clearly displayed. Is this waking or a dream, true or false?"


"In the mountain world, one day is here experienced as twelve million years. Discern whether this is true or false."


"There is no distinction between this and different dreams. From this, know that the essence of the world is thought alone."


"This unreal world dissolves in a moment. Therefore, abandon grief, O king, understanding that the world is like a dream."


"Considering yourself as a dream-picture on the wall, consciousness in essence, a reflection like in a mirror, so you are situated."


"Know the waking state as a picture in a mirror, and yourself as consciousness in essence. Become supremely blissful in heart quickly, O king."
Chapter 14
Hearing the sage's words and considering with an auspicious intellect, he quickly abandoned sorrow, knowing the world's state to be like a dream.


Taking hold of courage and free from sorrow, he again asked the sage's son: "O son of the sage, of great intelligence, seer of the past and future."


"I think there is nothing unknown to you, even slightly. I ask you, kindly tell me what I inquire about."


"You say all this arises from thought. How then does what I further contemplate not become external in any way?"


"You created the world in the mountain perfected by thought, but also how can place and time be diverse simultaneously?"


"Which of the two there is untrue? Reveal that to me. Thus asked, the sage's son began to explain."


"Intention and thought are said to be twofold: accomplished or unaccomplished. Accomplishment is the absence of alternatives, but unaccomplishment is due to fixed purpose on an alternative."


"See this world, born by thought of Brahman. Indeed, this is thought by all as real, firmly."


"Similarly, in one's own intention, there is no thought by anyone. This division of alternatives leads to unaccomplishment; therefore, it is diverse thought."


"The accomplishment of thought is established here in many ways: by birth, by gem, similarly by herb, and by yoga."


"By austerity, by mantra accomplishment, and by boon, O king, it is indeed by birth in Brahmanas, by gem in Yakshas and Rakshasas."


"But by herb, in gods, by yoga, of yogis, it is by austerity of ascetics, and by mantra of those with mantras."


"Of Vishvakarma and others, by boon attainment, it indeed became intended, similarly to be thought accomplished, by forgetting the past."


"Then the thought becomes stable, indeed until the previous is not remembered. Thus, indeed, non-dual thought if stable."


"Without desire, until it is not divided by alternatives, then that thought, indeed is accomplished, and achieves a great result."


"From division, due to alternatives, your thought is not accomplished. Accomplish the thought quickly if you desire to create."


"Listen, O king, to my speaking of the duality of place and time. You see, you are unaffected by the world's transactions, therefore…"


"This picture of the world appears indeed. Listen properly as I speak to you. This nature of the world's being which appears by diversity."


"Indeed, the light of the sun exists as twofold: to the day-blind, it is darkness; but to others, it is illuminating."


"Water obstructs the breath of humans and animals, but for fish and others, there is no breath obstruction in water."


"Fire burns mortals and others, but the water-bird devours that. Fire is extinguished by water, yet it sometimes burns in water."


"Thus, all entities in the world exist in dual forms. Similarly, some have sensory functions, while others are without senses."


"Indeed, by nature, there are hundreds and thousands of contradictions. Here, I will explain this with an attentive mind, listen."


"These objects, indeed, are mere modifications of the eye. There is nothing else visible anywhere outside of the eye."


"As one with jaundiced eyes sees everything as yellow, and another with cataract sees one thing as two."


"Thus, those with different defective eyes see the world in various ways. There is a place named Karandaka in the middle of the eastern sea."


"There, on the island, people always see objects as red. Similarly, people always see things in the island of Ramanaka."


"The entire realm of objects is reversed from top to bottom. Thus, in other islands, the realm of objects is various."


"People always see according to the nature of their eyes. There, if anything is seen otherwise, somewhere."


"By effective medicine, the eyes see as before. Thus, whatever is seen on the surface of the earth is seen by the eye."


"As long as the part of the eye is like yellow, due to jaundiced eyes, similarly the parts of the sense organs like smell and others are too, certainly."


"Mental and mere mind is, thus indeed the entire world. The order we see also arises from the nature of the senses, from that, nothing is outside."


"Listen, O king, that which appears merely outside in the world, that original nature of all worlds, is like the canvas of the world picture."


"Certainly, the support of that external, to be stated, is indeed the body. It is the support; otherwise, this world is not capable."


"What indeed is the support of that appearance outside? When stated as the mountain is outside, the mountain is not actually outside."


"As the pot appears outside, so likewise the body. It is not possible to state as outside from the perspective of the illuminator."


"The illumination of the lamp and sun's light from outside is not justified. Therefore, the internal illumination of the illuminator is thus only justified."


"The illuminator is not the body and others, as they are being illuminated like the mountain and others. The illuminator is not in any way the illuminated, indeed that is justified."


"If the illuminator is also being illuminated, there is instability of the illuminator. Indeed, oneself being the illuminator and being illuminated is not justified."


"Therefore, the illuminator is pure, having the sole nature of the illuminator. That, indeed, is the essence of light here, complete and of a single essence."


"By that, space and time are pervaded, due to its illumination. Its completeness is the essence of light, as the non-essence is absent anywhere."


"Whether inside or outside, whatever is situated within the essence of light, therefore, that would not be the support, just as the mountain is not the peak."


"In this way, the essence of light, engulfing all phenomena, shines independently in itself, everywhere and always."


"This supreme consciousness is called Tripura, the supreme goddess. The knowers of the Vedas call it Brahman, and the best of the Vaishnavas call it Vishnu."


"The best of the Shaivas call it Shiva, and those devoted to Shakti call it Shakti. Anything said apart from this form is insignificant."


"Indeed, pervaded by the power of consciousness, like the reflection in a mirror, its illumination is caused by the illuminated and the illuminated does not exist by itself."


"Indeed, the illuminated is submerged in light, like a city in a mirror. As the city in the mirror does not differ from the mirror."


"Likewise, the world shines in consciousness and does not differ from it, just as the complete, compact, single-form mirror self."


"As a separate city in a mirror in every way does not make sense, likewise, is the complete, compact, single-form conscious self."


"The world does not attain coherence of self in every way, but self like space, due to its nature of emptiness, does."


"The world always tolerates duality everywhere, but how can the existing consciousness, of non-empty nature and single essence, do so?"


"A second part, i.e., the world could be tolerated directly, like the nature of a mirror. Therefore, consciousness, like a mirror, possible due to the grandeur of independence."


"It would illuminate all moving and non-moving forms in the secondless, in its own form, devoid of cause and effect, highly vivid."


"As manifold forms shine in a mirror, even then, oneness shines clearly, without distinction, untainted."


"Likewise, in the varied world, even as manifold forms shine, one perfected by investigation remains, devoid of faults."


"O king, behold in your self the state of the kingdom of mind, manifold varied forms, even pure consciousness."


"In creation or in dissolution, that consciousness is like the undifferentiated, in presence or absence of the reflection, like a mirror."


"Even in this single form, consciousness, due to the cause of independence, illuminates within, like the sky in a mirror."


"This first establishment is called ignorance, darkness, due to this, it appears as if it is a part of the complete, as if illumination is called the external appearance."


"From the division of the complete I-feeling, this form of the I-feeling is indeed called the unmanifest, and is described as the inert power (causing ignorance)."


"Which consciousness, here manifesting externally in a fragmented manner, is said to be the Shiva principle. That power is its illumination."


"The external form is imagined as the great void, indeed, filled by the covering of the I-feeling, is remembered as always filled with Shiva."


"That indeed, in the primary state of inertia, is considered as called Ishvara. But the consciousness of these two (Jiva & Ishvara) is the examination of distinction and non-distinction."


"Thus, this much is called pure knowledge, said to be pure, due to the power of distinction not fully grown and due to the illumination of the non-distinct self."


"Then, due to the fullness of consciousness's independence, in the fully grown feeling of distinction, the inert power attained the state of possessing attributes, and consciousness attained the state of being the essence of attributes."


"Then, that inert power is considered the principle of illusion, but the intellect of distinction is due to the abundance of the feeling of distinction."


"Enveloped by the abundance of distinction, consciousness, contracted in nature, enveloped by the five sheaths, attains the state of the individual soul."


"The five sheaths are the power of action, power of knowledge, attachment, time, and destiny. The power of action results in limited doership, and the power of knowledge results in limited knowledge."


"Attachment is called thirst, limitation is due to lifespan, and time is called destiny. Endowed with  these, the individual soul becomes subservient."


"Presiding over by the power of consciousness, various beginningless actions of people, the aggregate of tendencies, established, is called nature."


"The result of actions is threefold because she (nature) has three forms. The difference in states is indeed called the mind."


"In deep sleep, one’s nature should be known. After that, it is called the mind. Consciousness with the aggregate of tendencies is said to be the mind."


"This unmanifest is indeed said to be due to the state of the aggregate of tendencies. By the distinction of individuals, the mind becomes various."


"Without distinction, that one state of beings in deep sleep indeed attains true nature. After that, it goes into the state of mind."


"This person is indeed said to be due to the predominance of consciousness. But due to the predominance of the unmanifest, it goes into the state of mind and nature."


"Due to the distinction of actions, that inner instrument is called threefold: ego, intellect, and mind, O best of kings."


"Of the knowledge and action senses, fivefold they would become. From that, separately, the elements are sound, sky, etc., both gross and subtle are born."


"Thus, the supreme consciousness, with the external appearance as a precursor, performs play in the order of creation, etc., witnessing all."


"There, influenced by the primordial power of Tripura in creation, Hiraṇyagarbha, who is Brahmā, arises from this contemplation."


"There, but the consciousness which manifests as 'you' and 'I', she is indeed the supreme power of consciousness. There is no distinction of that."


"The distinction appears due to limitations, indeed contemplated in Brahman. In the cessation of that contemplation, the appearance of distinction does not exist."


"The power of contemplation of consciousness, covered by illusion, but in the removal of that covering, you will attain success."


"Place, time, or something, are defined as contemplated by whom, thus it would appear there due to the difference in extent and subtlety."


"Contemplated by me as one day, that one day is indeed here, in the form of twelve billion years by Brahma."


"Thus contemplated by him, this appearance of difference of long and short duration, in the created mountain by Brahma, measured by a span and a gavyūti."


"But by me, due to contemplation of the infinite region in the mountain, thus both are here, true and false indeed."


"You also, within, contemplating a place measured by a krosha, and time formed of moments, can further contemplate there indeed, infinite yojanas."


"Innumerable time also appears as long as contemplation does. Therefore, this external world is the form of mere contemplation."


"In the form of consciousness, the unmanifest appears, O lord of men. Therefore, the world, full of images, is on the unmanifest background of the external self."


"She would be the mere unmanifest background, with her own consciousness as the background. Therefore, even a distant place is attainable for a yogi or a long time also."


"In a moment, they see it like a fruit in the palm, certainly. Therefore, whether far or near, long time or quickly."


"Perfected by mere contemplation, based on the mirror of consciousness, having ascertained thus, abandon delusion by the method of pure consciousness contemplation."


"Then you, like me, will become independent. Thus, having heard the words of the sage's son, the best of sages."


"Then he, having abandoned all delusion, the knower of the knowable, of auspicious disposition, by the practice of meditation, having perfected one's own contemplation."


"Having attained independence, then for a long time having enjoyed, but then uprooting the appearance of the body, taking refuge in the great sky."


"Mahāsena also attained supreme liberation, O descendant of Bhrigu. Thus, the world is true due to the cause of mere contemplation of existence."


"Consider this, O best of Bhrigus, the world shines in the form of the true self. By reflection, your delusion, resting in the mind, would attain peace."
Chapter 15
Thus, having heard the very wonderful story of the mountain world, Rama, the best of the Bhrigu lineage, was again extremely astonished.


Reflecting on what was said by the guru, with pure intellect, ascertaining, he again went to Dattatreya, bowed, and respectfully asked.


O Lord, what you said through various stories, I have thoroughly considered and known this much essence.


Consciousness is the one truth, and the object of consciousness is imagined there, like a city in a mirror, indeed considered false.


She, consciousness, is the supreme power, in the form of knowledge, the great goddess, who projects the picture of the world on her own self as the background, differentiated from the unmanifest, etc.


Manifests due to mere independence, without any cause. This much I have known, considering with subtle intellect.


But such consciousness, described as barren of the object of knowledge, is indeed impossible to attain, as the object of knowledge is always present.


Without the object of knowledge, how can there be perception of consciousness? Without perception, there is no purpose for it.


Purpose, even liberation, how would it be? Of what kind is it said? With knowledge being, liberation would be, but in liberation, how is activity?


Knowers are seen devoted to activity. How indeed is their object of consciousness said to be established in consciousness?


Being established in pure consciousness, how can there be activity? Knowledge being of one form, liberation would indeed be one result.


How is the difference in state of the knowers seen in the world? Some perform actions as per the true scriptures in time.


Some worship deities by different paths, while some are devoted to meditation with controlled senses.


Some perform austerities drying up the body and senses, while some enlighten disciples by separate discourses clearly.


Some govern kingdoms by the path of the law of punishment, while some debate in assemblies with opponents.


Some constantly compose various scriptures, while others merely always bring foolishness.


Some are always engaged in livelihoods condemned by the world, yet these knowers are thus famous and much criticized.


How is there a difference in state despite the absence of difference in practice and result? Are these knowers of equal knowledge, or have they resorted to difference?


You are able to explain all this to me completely. I, your disciple, have no other refuge, and your mind is naturally compassionate.


Thus, Atri's son (Dattatreya), asked by Bhargava with a clear mind, considering the series of questions appropriate, began to explain.


O Rāma, best among the wise, you certainly will reach that state, being devoted to good reflection, therefore you are endowed to know.


This indeed is that grace, which is good reflection; without divine grace, who attains auspiciousness?


Know this much as the duty of one's own deity; good reflection always increases when well pleased.


What you have known is indeed true; it is not otherwise. But even that which is spoken by you, the transcendental consciousness body.


What you have spoken is not well known by you, O Rāma. But as long as one knows with detachment (from experience), indeed, he does not know.


Because when that is properly known, it dispels detachment. But detached knowledge is like dream knowledge.


As dream treasure attainment is useless for people, thus detached knowledge would give non-primary results.


Here I will tell you a very wonderful ancient event. Formerly, in Videha, there was a very righteous king.


Janaka, the wise elder, well versed in higher and lower knowledge, once worshipped his own deity with supreme rituals.


There came Brāhmaṇas and others, learned ascetics, skilled in arts, Vedic scholars, ritualists, and possessors of sacrifices.


At that time, sacrifice to Varuṇa started, and many invited Brāhmaṇas and others did not go there.


Indeed, pleased by Janaka, honored and satisfied by him, then came Varuṇa's son with Buddhist wealth.


In the guise of a Brāhmaṇa, to lead Brāhmaṇas by deceit, reaching the sacrificial hall, uniting the king with blessings.


He reproached the members there, while the assembly members listened. 'O King, your sacrificial hall does not shine greatly.'


Like a lotus pond filled with crows and cranes, the assembly shines greatly with learned gatherings.


As an autumnal lake with flocks of swans and lotuses, here I do not see even one clear knowledge sufficiently.


"May it be well with you; I will go. My stay here will not be. How can I enter this assembly filled with fools?"


Thus addressed by Varuṇa's son, the members immediately became angry. 'Why, O relative of Brāhmaṇas, do you insult everyone?'


What is this knowledge of yours by which you have conquered all of us? Uselessly you boast, O foolish one; having conquered us, you will go.


Mostly, scholars situated in the earthly realm have indeed assembled. Why, O evil-minded one, do you wish to conquer only the earthly realm today?


Tell, what is your knowledge by which you desire to conquer us?" Thus, when the members said this, Varuṇa's son again said to them.


By agreement, I will conquer all of you in a moment. If I am conquered by you, I shall be submerged in the ocean.


"I will submerge you if conquered, or be submerged if I conquer. Approaching thus, let us argue by this agreement."


Thus said, the members agreed to argue with him. The Brāhmaṇas intensely argued with Varuṇa's son.


Varuṇa's son conquered the Brāhmaṇas by deceitful arguments, submerging hundreds and thousands of Brāhmaṇas in the ocean.


The Brāhmaṇas who were submerged were taken by Varuṇa's messengers. Approaching Varuṇa's sacrifice, they rejoiced, greatly honored.


Hearing that his father Kahola was submerged, then his son Aṣṭāvakra, skilled in disputation and knowledge, arrived.


Conquering Varuṇa's son, he commanded him to be submerged in the ocean. Then Varuṇa's son clearly summoned the foremost Brāhmaṇas.


He brought them from his own world, having been conquered by Aṣṭāvakra. Then, when the Brāhmaṇas arrived, Kahola's son greatly.


Freed all the Brāhmaṇas, he was surpassed with pride. Defeated by Aṣṭāvakra, the Brāhmaṇas came in sorrow.


At that time, they took refuge in an ascetic woman who arrived. Consoling them, the Brāhmaṇas, she, wearing ochre robes.


With matted hair, ever young, possessing a beautiful form, approaching the assembly, she spoke, highly honored by the king.


"Son of Kahola, dear, you are greatly wise. The Brāhmaṇas were freed by you, having conquered Varuṇa's son in argument."


"I ask you something, tell without deceit, which position, when known, leads to immortality for all."


In which position, when known, all doubts dissolve, nothing remains unknown, and nothing is desirable.


"If you know the unknown, tell me immediately." Thus asked by the ascetic woman, Kahola's son said.


"I know that position, listen again, O ascetic woman. Indeed, there is nothing unknown to me in this world of any measure."


"I have thoroughly studied all the scriptures repeatedly. What you ask, I will tell, listen truly, O ascetic woman."


"Indeed, that is the cause of all worlds, devoid of beginning, middle, and end, unbounded by space and time, pure, indivisible consciousness."


"Indeed, that which supports all this world, shines like a city in a mirror; that is the supreme position."


"Knowing that, one attains the state of steady immortality, like a mirror when known, there would be no doubt anywhere."


"In the infinite reflections, nothing would be unknown, nor anything undesirable, thus when the supreme is known."


"And that too is unknown to others due to the absence of the means of knowledge; thus, O ascetic woman, that essence is perceived by the view of scriptures."


"Thus, hearing the words of Aṣṭāvakra, she said again, 'O sage's boy, your words are rightly said as agreed upon by all.'"


"What you said is unknown due to the absence of the means of knowledge, thus, knowing that indeed attains the immortal and unchanging state."


"If you think the previous and latter words are consistent, how can I not know the unknown and say it that state exists? Explain."


"If you know it is (that state), do not say it is unknown. Then, this indeed, O learned one, is perceived by the view of scriptures by you."


"You do not know that yourself, therefore it is not directly perceived; seeing all reflections directly as they are."


"You do not know the mirror directly, thus how do you say that? Thus speaking in the assembly, in front of Janaka indeed."


"You do not think you are humiliated, how do you say that? Thus told by her, he did not speak anything there."


"He became despondent as if, instantly ashamed, head down, standing for a moment, considering within, said by her."


"The best of the twice-born, not finding the answer to that question, said to her, 'O ascetic woman, I do not know the answer to your question.'"


"I am your disciple, tell me how this is explained. I do not say anything false, which is a destroyer of penance and useless."


"Thus asked, the ascetic woman, truly pleased with him, replied to Aṣṭāvakra and the listening  assembly."


"Dear, not knowing this, many have come to delusion; by dry logic, it is unknowable and well hidden everywhere."


"In such assemblies, no one knows; this king knows, or I know, indeed no one else."


"Everywhere in disputes, this question-answer leads nowhere; mostly, the learned try to know, relying only on logic."


"This is not well known by logic, even by subtle intellect anywhere; without serving the true guru and by the grace of the deities."


"O sage's son, I will say this, listen with a subtle mind; even after hearing this, it is not knowable indifferently by breathing mind."


"As long as this knowledge is not realized in the self, so much spoken and heard, even thousands of times, is useless."


"As someone with a pearl necklace on his own neck, carelessly not realizing, thinks it has been taken by thieves, in a deluded state."


"Even after being awakened and told by someone that it is on the neck, as long as he does not realize himself and see his neck."


"Until then, he does not obtain the necklace on the neck, even with subtle investigation. Thus, O sage's son, realize the self and its own nature."


"Even if very skilled, until one realizes the inner self, how can one know it from outside?"


"As a lamp illuminates objects everywhere, but does not illuminate itself anywhere."


"Thus, the sun and others illuminate themselves without depending on another illuminator, all are situated as illuminators."


"And thus, what about lamps, due to non-illumination, do not exist or illuminate, it is appropriate to say."


"Thus, with illuminating objects existing in lamps, absolutely non-illuminating, how do you say that is the nature of consciousness?"


"If it illuminates without being perceivable, that is doubtful; therefore, you consider all this properly with an inward-facing vision."


"This supreme consciousness power, Tripura, all-encompassing, all-illuminating, where and when does it not shine?"


"When it does not shine, then what indeed? By non-illumination also, the consciousness power shines."


"How does non-illumination appear? How does it not shine, tell me. If it shines, how does it shine? Consider this with subtlety."


"Here, all, even skillful scholars do not see. Without inner vision, deluded by this, they wander."


"As long as vision does not remain by renouncing activity, so long, inner vision does not exist in any way."


"As long as one does not attain inner vision, so long, one does not see it. Inner vision should be desireless, how can that be with effort?"


"Abandoning that properly, resort to your own nature. For a moment, relying on your own essence, without deliberation, then beyond."


"Considering through memory, then you know everything, unknowable and well-known, that is said to be the truth."


"Knowing thus the unknowable, one may attain the immortal state. This is all spoken to you, O sage's son, salutations be to you."


"I go, as this is not known by you through once hearing. This king, the best among the wise, will enlighten you."


"Ask again your doubts, the king will clear them all. Having said this, she was honored by the king and bowed by the assembly."


Like a cloud streak driven by the wind, it disappeared in a moment. This is explained to you, O Rama, the process of perception of the self.
Chapter 16
Having heard this, Rama, the son of Bhargava, experienced wonder within and asked Atri's son again, unsatisfied by hearing the story.


O Lord, this ancient event heard is indeed wonderful. The great sage Ashtavakra again asked the king.


What the king replied to him, tell that to me completely. Oh, this wonderful story I have never heard.


O Guru, with compassion, tell me all about knowledge and action. Thus asked, the great sage Dattatreya then… 


Narrated to Bhargava a supremely purifying story. Listen, O Bhargava, to what was spoken by the great soul Janaka.


When the ascetic woman had departed, Ashtavakra, the sage's son, surrounded by many sages, met the foremost of kings.


He asked what the ascetic woman briefly spoke, which was significant. That being said by me, listen properly and attentively.


O King, lord of Videha, what the ascetic woman said, I did not know properly due to the brevity of the statement.


How is that knowledge unknowable? Explain, O ocean of compassion. Thus asked, Janaka spoke to him, as if in wonder.


O sage's son, listen to the words spoken by me now. That is not unknowable in every way, indeed also not knowable in every way.


If it is unknowable in every way, what would the guru say? The guru should impart the truth, therefore, one should first seek refuge in the guru.


This knowledge is extremely easy and also difficult indeed. For one whose vision is turned inward, that would be easy.


For one whose vision is outward, that is extremely difficult indeed. Only indescribable, that is unknowable in every way.


Somehow, in a different form, it can be described and knowable. Whatever visible you see here, by that it is said to be knowable.


Whatever appears to you, contemplate that with a pure mind. The power of illumination, without the illuminated, is the source of all illumination.


Consider that reality, thus understand, O sage's son. The knowable is not knowledge itself, which does not illuminate.


Knowledge is other by which the knowable is known, not by itself anywhere. The knowable in different forms is known indeed by knowledge.


By different forms, knowledge does not differentiate anywhere. The difference is indeed the property of the knowable, not of knowledge anywhere.


The difference in form indeed appears in the knowable side. See the knowable separately by intellect without form.


As the mirror's reflection, likewise this consciousness assumes multiple forms of the visible form.


Thus, this knowledge is knowable in a form distinct from the knowable. But by nature, that knowledge is not knowable and is all-pervading.


Because this form of the knower is not known, therefore contemplate, O Aṣṭāvakra, on your own form, which is such and clear.


You are not the body, life-force, or mind due to their instability. The body is a collection of elements, how can that be your form?


And that transcends the perception of other objects, thus the life-force and mind also would transcend the ego-mind.


This supreme consciousness remains without transcending the ego-mind, therefore, you, O Aṣṭāvakra, are the knower of all in essence.


See with the turned inward vision your own pure consciousness. Those with the highest intellect see their own self indeed at the instruction time.


Your vision is not this eyeball, but the mind's eye is said. By which you see in dreams, that vision is called the primary one.


Its turning inward is also said, listen, O learned one. The unturned inward vision indeed does not see anything.


Desiring to see something with vision entirely from others, if one would firmly connect by turning inward in that indeed.


Then that shines clearly, but not otherwise at any time. Otherwise, the outward-oriented vision does not shine clearly at any time.


Indeed, as though not shining, would be with unturned inward vision. Thus, understand the state of hearing, skin, etc., O learned one.


Thus indeed, with the mind, the perception of happiness and sorrow would be. With the unturned inward mind, one is not able to know anything.


Therefore, that singular focus and turning inward of the vision, the turned inward mind, is pure, reflecting its own form.


Here I will explain to you, listen, that specific distinction. If that self is beyond the senses, it is also within the senses with the mind.


Here many are confused, those who distinguish Vedic scriptures. The mind's scope is externally situated in two ways.


The first turning inward from others is superior, focused on that. But even the mere turning inward from others of the mind is being.


Not shining anything, the object at the edge opportunities, therefore, the focus on that is here also a superior mental activity.


Thus, the turned inward of them, the two activities shining, because the unturned inward consciousness, therefore, here it would not be thus.


But from others, the mere turning inward would shine, as in the mirror in front for seeing something.


But from others, the turning inward and facing of that is expected, like desiring to see the reflection in the mirror.


When one desires to see the sky in the mirror, then by mere turning inward from other things, the accomplishment is achieved.


The sky, pervading everywhere, is always situated in the mirror. But if unturned and covered by other things, it does not shine.


Supporting and pervading all, even when covered by them, therefore, by mere turning inward from them, it indeed shines.


Thus, consciousness, pervading and supporting all, is situated at all times, fully complete in the mind, like space, O twice-born.


Therefore, mere turning inward from others of the mind is desired. See, O wise one, where and when consciousness is not shining.


When and where it is not, nor when and where it is, therefore, in the shining of the self-consciousness, by the mind's turning inward from others.


It is not merely dependent on some, nor is it entirely new at times. Indeed, due to the absence of dependence, it is said to be unknowable.


Therefore indeed, pure mind perceived is said to be that reality. But from others, indeed, turning inward is mental purity.


This indeed is said to be the supreme means in the knowledge of reality. As long as the mind is not pure, then how would knowledge be?


When the mind is pure, how would knowledge surely not be? All the means here are for its purification.


Action, worship, even dispassion, are engaged indeed for the purification of the mind, and not otherwise.


Therefore, with a pure mind, that supreme form shines. Thus, hearing what was said by the king, Aṣṭāvakra again spoke.


O king, you said, turning inward from others is indeed mental. If that alone is supreme, consciousness shines with the mind.


If that turned inward mind would shine in deep sleep, then what is the use of other means? Is accomplishment done from mere sleep?


Thus addressed by the sage, the king then said, "Hear, O sage, composed, I speak the resolution to you."


Truly, in deep sleep, the mind's turning inward is complete. It is a dissolved mind, and you also, now how would it shine?


When the mirror is covered with ink, the sky does not shine in the mirror. But sometimes, by mere turning inward from others, it shines.


Thus, when the mind is covered by sleep, turned inward from others, due to unsuitability, the mind does not shine consciousness anywhere.


In other times, why wouldn't it shine even on clod, wall, etc.? Therefore, it indeed shines with a suitable, pure mind.


Therefore, it is similar to as nothing shines for a newborn child. Even then, listen, I will explain, what happens when the mirror is covered with ink.


Even when it is covered with ink, the reflection exists unseen, indeed. Due to blending, it is not distinguished from its nature, due to non-removal of ink.


Similarly, the mind situated in deep sleep is blended by sleep. Therefore, due to the absence of turning away from others, blended with sleep, it does not shine.


Therefore, note that the memory of sleep occurs even for one who has arisen. Observe the confusion experienced in that state.


I will explain that to you correctly. Listen properly, composed. The mind has two states, distinguished by illumination and reflection.


The rest in external objects is called illumination. The reflection on that in oneself is indeed mentioned as reflection.


Illumination would be non-conceptual due to non-distinction of objects. Reflection is conceptual due to word distinction and distinction.


This kind, thus devoid of word distinction, of the form of object perception, that illumination is non-conceptual.


This kind, thus based on object perception, of the form distinguished by words, that reflection's self-illumination.


Internal, new, or another, is mentioned as reflection. Therein, the new appearance is said to be experiential.


Another is of the nature of memory and investigation, arising from impressions. Thus, the mind, endowed with two kinds of power, is always situated.


That deep sleep, of the form of sleep and illumination, long-standing, full of waking reflection, is called the non-deluded state.


Because deep sleep is dense with illumination and of the nature of confusion, therefore, indeed, it is like a lamp due to the density of illumination.


Determined as confusion by all, even by the wise in every way, sleep is called the first-born, unmanifest, great void here.


There is no common state of deep sleep. Its illumination, during object perception, even in waking, the mind is of this kind.


But hidden by the flood of concepts arising  in the next moment, in deep sleep, due to the density of illumination of unmanifest power.


Thus, the discerning ones discern the mind as dissolved. During object perception, even thus, the mind becomes dissolved.


Listen, O sage, I will explain to you the secret from my own experience, where even the wise and highly subtle discerners get confused.


Non-conceptual absorption, deep sleep, and object perception, this trio is of one kind due to the density of illumination.


Due to the difference in reflection, distinction is observed by practitioners. The cause there is determined to be the difference in objects.


In absorption, pure consciousness; in sleep, unmanifest; and in perception, differentiated appearance. Thus, the object is situated in a threefold manner.


Despite differences in the objects, the illumination is only non-conceptual. Therefore, it is called dense illumination.


Absorption and deep sleep, due to their long duration, are subsequently clearly discerned by all.


Due to momentariness, perception is not clearly discerned. Thus, absorption and sleep, being momentary, are not discerned.


Deep sleep is momentary; likewise, absorption also exists. Deep sleep is observed by those with subtle vision, due to familiarity, indeed.


Absorption, indeed, due to unfamiliarity, is not discerned as subtle by all beings, O sage, even in states of activity.


Subtle absorptions are present but do not appear due to lack of cultivation. In waking, the non-reflection which is, is stated as absorption.


The mere absence of reflection is called absorption. Thus, the state of absorption is situated in deep sleep and in perception.


But primary absorption is not found in these two. Due to being imbued with impressions of absence of distinction, there is no primacy.


Perception in waking becomes of the nature of non-reflection. Yet, I will explain to you, O sage's son, with respect. Listen.


The unmanifest, which is first-born, is not common. Indeed, its perception as "it does not exist" is of the nature of absolute non-existence.


This deep sleep is thus said to be the inert power of consciousness. In perception, appearing, it does not reach the state of appearance.


Therefore, deep sleep is indeed associated with inert perception. In absorption, the consciousness that appears is of the nature of Brahman.


Devouring time and space, destroyer of the appearance of non-existence, completely made of existence, how can that goddess be deep sleep?


Therefore, mere deep sleep does not become fulfillment. Janaka thus enlightened Aṣṭāvakra with these words.
Chapter 17
Having heard thus from Janaka, Ashtavakra again asked the king. What he asked, I will tell you. Listen attentively, O descendant of Bhrigu.


O king, you said that even in states of activity, there are subtle absorptions. Thus, tell me that clearly.


In which states are those absorptions of non-conceptual consciousness? Thus asked by him, the great king then said.


Listen, O sage, I will explain the absorptions in activities. When first embraced by the beloved, newly.


Then, the man does not know the external or internal for a moment. He remains not overpowered by sleep. That is called absorption.


When something long desired, determined as unattainable, is suddenly attained, O sage.


Then, the man does not know the external or internal for a moment. He remains not overpowered by sleep. That is called absorption.


Unexpectedly going somewhere, fearless with a delighted mind, if suddenly sees a tiger, etc., like death.


Then, the man does not know the external or internal for a moment. He remains not overpowered by sleep. That is called absorption.


When very dear, one's own son, etc., the lord in household duties, suddenly hears as dead, indeed.


Then, the man does not know the external or internal for a moment. He remains not overpowered by sleep. That is called absorption.


Now, I will also tell otherwise the origin of absorption. Listen, there are absorptions in between waking, dreaming, and deep sleep.


Seeing something at a distance with a one-pointed intellect, O sage, the mind goes into an elongated state like a leech on the blades of grass.


In the body, consisting of the appearance of the body, and in the state of feeling, likewise, in between, observe the mind always in the state called non-conceptual.


What is the use of many words here? Listen, O subtle examiner, in activities, the knowledge of anyone does not shine as one.


This activity consists of fragmented knowledge and groups. Therefore, all philosophers indeed describe it as such.


The self or intellect, divided by moments, stands in the state of non-conceptuality in the stream of those moments.


O son of Kahola, know that for the knowers, there is absorption every moment. For another, absorption is like the horn of a rabbit.


Having heard thus said by Janaka, the sage again asked, "O king, is absorption non-conceptual in activity?"


If that is for everyone, how would there be transmigration? In deep sleep and perception, appearing inert and indistinct.


The accomplishment of human goals is indeed through non-conceptual absorption, where the pure consciousness shines as the self. How then can there be transmigration again?


This knowledge is indeed the destroyer of the family of ignorance, called non-conceptual absorption, which is the cause of the highest good.


"O king, tell me this, the destroyer of all doubts," thus asked, the king said to the sage.


Listen, O sage, I will tell you this supreme secret. From ignorance, this transmigration has arisen from beginningless time.


The appearances of pleasure and pain are established by the nature of flow, like a dream, continuously experienced by all, always.


The cessation of that is understood to be from knowledge alone. That knowledge may be conceptual, which removes ignorance.


Ignorance is not removed by non-conceptual knowledge alone. Non-conceptual knowledge is not opposed by anyone.


Together, non-conceptual knowledge, supported by conceptual, is well-established like a wall for varied appearances.


Non-conceptual knowledge alone is called knowledge. Indeed, due to the mentioning of concepts, it becomes conceptual.


Ignorance, known as conceptual knowledge, is indeed not otherwise. That is established as various kinds of cause and effect.


The cause is declared to be known as the fullness of one's own self. The conscious self may indeed be complete due to the absence of limitation.


The adept is indeed of the absence of limitation of parts and so forth. The knowledge of such a self is established as incompleteness.


Here now, in the form of 'I am', that root ignorance may indeed be. The appearance of body-self and so forth is in the form of a sprout of that.


The cessation of ignorance does not lead to the end of transmigration. Indeed, ignorance does not cease without complete self-knowledge.


That complete self-knowledge is well-established as of two kinds: indirect and direct. The indirect comes from teacher and scripture.


It is established that direct knowledge is not the cause of human goals. Your knowledge may be as arising from scripture and hearing.


Knowledge obtained merely by faith is not said to yield fruit. Direct knowledge indeed arises from the maturation of absorption.


Absorption, not obstructed by ignorance with elaboration, certainly yields auspicious fruit. Absorption preceded by knowledge indeed produces knowledge.


Therefore, no benefit arises in absorption for the ignorant, just as seeing an unknown ruby in a box.


Just as another person, having seen a gem known by hearing somewhere, immediately recognizes it.


Even if one is very skilled, if not devoted, one may see a gem somewhere again and again without recognizing it, O sage.


Similarly, deluded ones do not find the fruit based on knowledge. Even the learned, if ignorant, do not recognize it.


Due to not being devoted, they do not recognize at all, just as one does not recognize a star even when seeing it.


The deluded, devoid of heard knowledge, even if endowed with it, indeed, do not recognize even if they see, due to the absence of devotion.


One who, having heard about the Venus star by the characteristics of direction and form, determines that it should be known by them in every way, is a wise man devoted to that.


With a focused mind, one will recognize it clearly. Thus, due to ignorance and lack of devotion, the deluded ones do not recognize it.


They do not recognize their own self in the presence of absorptions, O sage, wandering for alms due to bad luck, just as one who has forgotten his treasure.


Therefore, all these states of absorptions are purposeless. Indeed, for children, the non-conceptual state is always present.


No fruit is yielded from the non-removal of ignorance, O sage. Knowledge, which is based on recognition, may be conceptual.


That indeed removes the ignorance, the root of transmigration. Pleased by acts in many births, the self-deity becomes satisfied.


Then the desire for liberation arises, it does not arise otherwise, even in millions of ages. Awareness in births is supremely rare.


Very rare among them, indeed, is human birth in every way. Even there, subtle intellect is extremely rare.


See, O sage, among the immobile beings, even a hundredth part is considered. Indeed, among them, the mobile beings are not seen as even a hundredth part.


There is no equal humanity, even there, consider. Millions of humans are seen like animals.


Those who do not know good and bad, virtue or sin, others also, millions of mortals, are engaged and engrossed in desires.


Delighting in the coming and going, proud of the semblance of wisdom, among such people, but some are wise ones.


With minds full of impurity, they also are disbelievers in the non-dual state. Covered by the divine illusion, they do not perceive the non-dual supreme state.


How can that state be attained by all, by those blinded by illusion, by the unfortunate? Indeed, the intellect of those blinded by illusion does not ascend to that state.


Others, with bad fortune, even if intellectually advanced, here, who with false notions, again are denied by wrong imaginations.


Alas, the divine illusion, even seeing the great state, the wish-fulfilling gem in hand, they abandon indeed by wrong imaginations.


Those whose self-deity is pleased by worship, they are liberated from illusion, endowed with good reasoning and faith.


Established in non-duality, they attain the supreme state. I will explain the sequence to you, O sage, listen attentively.


Devotion to the deity is obtained by the merits of countless births. Worshipping for a long time, by that grace, thereafter.


Attains disinterest in the objects of enjoyment and devotion to that, through dispassion and devotion, and associated with faith.


Having attained the true guru, by his instruction, one knows non-duality, the supreme state. This knowledge is indeed indirect, for non-duality exists thus here.


Then, properly contemplate non-duality, the self-deity, by establishing with sound reasoning and dispelling doubts.


Then, having firmly established the principle of the self, non-dual, with respect, meditate directly with determination and effort.


Then, making the supreme state the object of meditation, destroys ignorance, the root of transmigration, no doubt about it.


In mature meditation, in non-dual samadhi, called the supreme state, having attained, then recalling, becomes recognizing.


He, the non-dual self, thinking "I am," directly destroys the root of transmigration, ignorance, with parts, quickly.


The maturity of meditation is indeed the renunciation of thoughts; thought is various perceptions, but in one way, non-dual.


By not even mentioning others, thought is renounced; when thought is renounced, thereafter non-dual is naturally established.


As in the painting, when cleansed, the pure wall remains, indeed the making of the pure wall is cleaning the painting, indeed.


Thus, by the removal of thought, the mind is naturally non-dual; non-dual self-attainment is indeed the renunciation of thought.


There is no higher state to be attained than this pure state; even wise ones are deluded here by the power of illusion.


The wise perceive this state in a moment, indeed; O sage, there are three  types of qualified ones: highest, lowest, and middle.


The highest understand that state at the first instruction; contemplation and meditation also happen at the same time as hearing.


For the highest, indeed, there is no effort in attaining that state; once, in the summer night adorned with moonlight.


Embraced by the beloved, seated in a blooming garden on a luxurious bed, intoxicated by wine.


I heard in the sky the sweet words of a group of siddhas, referring to the principle of non-duality, and realized that state at that time.


Realized through contemplation and meditation at that very moment; thus, in half a moment, having realized that pure state.


For a moment, I became more with a concentrated mind, completely immersed in the ocean of supreme bliss.


Then, having attained memory, I became engrossed in contemplation; oh, this wonderful state is indeed filled with bliss and nectar.


Having attained this unprecedented state again, I enter it; not even a fraction of the happiness of Indra and others would be sufficient in that state.


The happiness of this state, even in a fraction, is not comparable up to Brahma; until today, indeed, I have wasted this time.


Without knowing one's own treasure adorned with wish-fulfilling gems, one wanders for alms, indeed, seeking flour in a fist.


Alas, people, deluded by ignorance of their own self-bliss, attain external happiness, only a fraction, with great effort.


Enough of this vain effort for external happiness; I would indeed always be devoted to the infinite bliss.


Enough of this external activity for me; like grinding flour and reproof, indeed.


Those foods, those indeed, garlands, and beds, varied ornaments, and pleasures with women.


Mostly long stale, yet enjoyed again, following others, my disgust indeed does not arise.


Thus deciding, as much as I turned inward again, then another auspicious contemplation approached me.


Oh, this delusion of mind, why has it approached me? Even being blissfully complete self, I am indeed always established.


What do I wish to do again? What is there to be obtained by me? What have I not obtained, where, when, or how is it attained?


How could the achievement of the unachieved be true? Oh, how could there be action in my form of infinite consciousness and bliss?


The body, senses, and inner faculties are indeed like a dream; all these are indeed mine, of the indivisible one consciousness-self.


What would happen if one inner faculty is restrained? Even if others are unrestrained, they are indeed my minds.


Thus, if one mind is restrained, what would happen to me? Restrained and unrestrained minds completely shine in me.


In the restraint of all minds, there is no restraint for me; from the vast and extensive space, where is the restraint in me?


Thus, how could absorption (samadhi) be in me, filled with complete consciousness-bliss, more complete than the sky?


How could there be any action for me, by which good and bad even exist, in the infinite body-self appearances due to my greatness?


What is the use of the appearance or absence of action for me? There is not even the least to be done or not to be done by me.


Therefore, what would be in restraint for me, full of bliss, whether in absorption or not, of true complete nature?


In whichever action this body is established, let it remain there itself; thus, I am serene in every way, an abode of great bliss.


Of unending radiance form, I am completely full and stainless; thus, this is my declared state of the highest.


For the inferior, the fruit born of knowledge comes after many births; for the middle, it comes gradually through hearing and contemplation.


Meditation becomes, then knowledge arises; absorption joined with the fruit of realization becomes rare.


What is the use of hundreds of absorptions without the fruit of realization? Therefore, devoid of realization, there is no fruit by those absorptions.


Even going in the world, in the paths illuminated by non-dual awareness, not knowing the objects, their ignorance does not end.


Realization known as non-dual, pure knowledge, own form, that always shines, indeed, even if not perceived.


By the covering of conceptions, indeed, in the removal of conceptions, the shining appears more, unprecedentedly.


By the non-difference of knowledge and the known, the unknown is said to be known; thus, this becomes the highest order of self-realization.


O Brahmin, thus heard, contemplating again, you should know; then, knowing the self-principle, you will become accomplished.


Thus instructed by Janaka, the great sage Aṣṭāvakra, honored and permitted, respectfully returned to his own place.


Through contemplation and meditation, realizing the supreme state, removing all doubts, he quickly became liberated while living.
Chapter 18
O Bhārgava, thus indeed that consciousness is described as objectless. The states of its realization are heard in many ways, indeed.


People deluded by illusion do not know due to lack of discernment. That state is realized by subtle vision, indeed, not otherwise, anywhere.


What use is much talking to you, O Rāma? Listen, I speak the essence. The object is known by the mind; therefore, the mind is not known.


Thus, the mind also, free from objects, could be. That mind, free from objects, is called awareness.


By the nature of realization, that is always known indeed. Dependence on other realizations would be blindness from instability.


O Bhārgava, how do you see any object, yet do not shine? If you do not shine, then how is your question?


Oh, being like a sky-flower, how do you desire benefit? How can I help your self? Reflect on this.


If you say you do not know me generally shining specifically, O Rāma, indeed your form is general and unchanging.


Without a trace of specificity, this much indeed is your form. Oh, knowing even, you are very much confused again in vain.


The illuminator of everything may be a specific object; therefore, by yourself, you shine as a general form, indeed.


If you shine by body, etc., as self, listen, I tell you: you shine as the body-self by conception, indeed, not otherwise.


Consider with subtle vision, in the conception of another as body, whether it appears as your bodiness; and that body also becomes yours.


Thus, whatever body is conceived, that indeed becomes yours; by that, you would be all-pervading. How could you be only the body-self?


Therefore, your visible form would not be by variation. Therefore, you are of the form of pure seeing, not ever the seer or seen.


That self-luminous form, devoid of any trace of distinction, is filled with manifold diversity of body, place, time, and differences.


Therefore, by abandoning conception alone, perceive the form of your own self, remaining beyond, situated in pure consciousness.


Thus, once perceived, that which is situated without attribute, that ignorance, the cause of all transmigration, dissolves.


Liberation is not in the sky, netherworld, or on earth; it is indeed the manifestation of the pure self by abandoning conception.


That is never unattained by being the self-nature; only by the removal of mere delusion is fulfillment.


Another liberation, separate from the self-nature, is not conceivable, as it would be perishable due to being created; indeed, it would be like a hare's horn.


The own nature being completely full, where can another liberation happen? Liberation arising in one's own nature is like a reflection in a mirror.


Even in the world, liberation without the disappearance of bondage is not conceived. The disappearance would indeed be non-existence; how can the real be of the nature of non-existence?


An entity of the nature of existence and non-existence is not possible anywhere. Thus, dream states are of the nature of both existence and non-existence.


If they are real, the cause of negation would indeed make them unreal. Listen: negation is the notion of non-existence, which occurs in the absence of the notion.


That which is associated with negation is unreal, indeed not otherwise. Negation exists for all visible things in the absence of the notion.


Therefore, it would indeed be unreal, established as the nature of existence and non-existence, whose touch of non-existence is never anywhere.


Thus, the nature of consciousness, true in all respects, is established. Therefore, separate liberation would not be true at all.


Liberation of the complete self is said to be its own manifestation. By mere abandonment of objects, consciousness is proclaimed as full.


The manifestation of objects indeed is the contraction of consciousness. In the absence of objects, consciousness is full by the absence of limitation.


If limitation by time, etc., is defined for that, tell whether the limitation would be by the non-conscious or by the conscious.


By the non-conscious, indeed, it would be unreal; by the conscious, that indeed is pervasive. In the world, any entity conceived as limited by time.


When entity and time attain the state of being limited and unlimited, then consciousness indeed would be pervasive in such.


When consciousness is not pervasive, how would limitation be established? When an object is outside of consciousness, that would be limitation.


The establishment of objects outside of consciousness is not appropriate in any way. How would that which is outside be established, devoid of connection with consciousness?


Even connection would not be partial; otherwise, it would be unreal. Mere connection with that part, from appearance, other is not established.


Therefore, the object outside should be considered immersed in consciousness. Thus, in all respects, the object indeed should be considered immersed.


How would the object, completely immersed in its own interior, be self-limiting? O Rama, consider logically such an object.


The object appearing within consciousness would be like a reflection. The object within the interior of the object is not clearly seen in the world.


If the objects indeed would be mixed, O Rama, in all respects, the external object stated by you is indeed based on illusion.


Tell, how would the reality of objects dependent on that be? The nature of consciousness, indeed one's own self, is always as the essence of those objects.


It appears by its own free power, and nothing more exists anywhere. Hearing this statement, Bhārgava asked again.


O Lord, what you said appears difficult to me. The pure consciousness appearing as varied is impossible.


Consciousness and object are conceived as twofold entities by all. There, the object is illumined by consciousness, and consciousness is self-luminous to you.


Just as an object illumined by light is indeed separate from it, thus, the object illumined by consciousness is distinct.


The object being of the nature of consciousness is not an experience. Moreover, it was previously said by the great soul, Janaka.


By abandonment of thoughts, the mind indeed becomes without duality. That same non-dual state becomes the knowledge that destroys worldly existence.


That is indeed said to be the form of the self. How would that be? For the mind is indeed said to be the instrument of the self in knowledge and action.


If the mind is not of the self, how would it be distinguished from the inert? O Lord, indeed, the mind's difference from the inert is due to the self.


For indeed, bondage and liberation of the self are clearly by the mind. The mind with duality is bondage, and liberation is without duality.


How is the mind itself the self, when the mind is considered an instrument? Even in the perfection of the non-dual, duality remains.


Even if seen in the world, one whose delusion is non-existent, indeed he, not by falsehood is delusion, how would that be non-duality?


Utility is not corrupted anywhere by a false object. All worldly objects indeed are stable and utility-producing.


Tell, how is that falsehood established as non-duality? All delusive knowledge and the distinction between delusion and non-delusion, how is it?


Tell me, O teacher, how can delusion be all-pervading? This doubt has been revolving in my heart for a long time.


Thus, hearing this question, the all-knowing Dattatreya, delighted by the good question, commenced to speak.


O Rāma, well done, this question is often asked. Until the mind is satisfied, one should keep clarifying.


How would a teacher say what is in the mind if unasked? Indeed, due to differences in intellect, reasoning is established differently among beings.


Without asking one's own opinion, who is freed from doubt? Indeed, the question is the seed of firm knowledge for the questioner in clarification.


Without asking, knowledge would not be at all. Having asked, one would know from the teacher. Thus, consciousness, though one only, may appear due to variety.


Just as a mirror of one form appears in many ways from reflections, see in dreams and imaginations, the mind is indeed one only.


Thus, consciousness shines through the diversity of seer, seeing, and seen. Indeed, she is pure and illuminates various forms.


Consciousness and the perceived appear as duality even in dreams. Without light, the blind surely do not know existence.


The form appearing to the blind shines only in memory. Without the light of consciousness, when and where does anything shine?


Just as without a mirror, no reflection shines, so too, from the mirror, the reflection is not separate.


Thus, without consciousness, nothing separate is known. Therefore, the mind is not other than consciousness in any way.


Just as the mind is in dreams, so too in waking, the mind is not different. The mind is merely an instrument imagined for the completion of actions.


Just as a dream axe is an instrument for cutting trees, O Rāma, actions are false forms; how can that instrument be true?


Who has ever been well-cut by a man's horn, a false thing? Therefore, O Rāma, the mind, too, is not the cause of false action.


In dreams, the mind is said to be the instrument for vision, action, and other activities. Just as in dreams, so always, the mind is not the doer of actions.


Consciousness, pure and free, imagines the mind and other instruments, and engages in activities through the diversity of the seen and the seer.


Sometimes, sometimes only, it is established in non-duality. Listen, O Bhārgava, the nature of consciousness, even when full, itself.


Not like space, consciousness is self-illuminating, thus established. Space and the consciousness-self are  not distinct from each other.


Full, subtle, pure, unborn, infinite, formless, the support of all, unattached, the self, being inside and outside all.


There is no distinction in consciousness and space; in reality, the self, full of consciousness, is indeed called space.


Indeed, there is no difference between the self and space, even a little. What is space is indeed the self; and what is the self is indeed space.


The ignorant see the nature of the self as space, indeed, from delusion, just as an owl sees only darkness in sunlight.


But the wise see space as the essence of self-consciousness. The supreme consciousness, the supreme lord, pure and free in splendor.


Illuminates the self as limited in many ways, just as, O Rāma, one sees oneself in dreams in many ways, separately.


You illuminate through distinctions of humans, etc., thus indeed. Even the illumination in many ways is surely by limited vision.


By one's own vision, the supreme consciousness is indeed in the form of the complete self. Even a magician, though one, sees oneself in many ways.


Illuminating there, the supreme consciousness shines by the vision of the seers, itself indeed one and changeless.


Even the pure, one form shines in many limited ways, covered by illusion.


This illusion's cover comes of limited vision, as a magician covered by illusion appears differently.


Illusion created by others, extremely difficult to overcome, even in the world, yogis, others adept in mantras, and magicians.


Covering their own freedom, attaining something with proper reasoning, they accomplish difficult tasks, thus this is not very surprising.


Thus, O son of Bhṛgu, from the pure freedom of the supreme consciousness, the form of one's self shines in many limited ways.


Limitation of ego is well established in one place, which is also famous as incompleteness, described as ignorance.


Here many logicians and scholars are deluded, not realizing their own self, being with outward vision.


Anything taught by the guru, whether true or untrue, one does not realize until they realize their own self.


Until then, one does not obtain the fruit by indirect knowledge from scripture. Therefore, O Rāma, I have said, you see within yourself with true vision.


The supreme consciousness, which is the goddess of all common forms, is full of light and separate from inertness.


Therefore, the rest in one's own self is indeed the ego in another form. The inert rested in the consciousness self shines in the self of consciousness.


Not shining in its own form by itself, therefore, there is no rest in the own self. The consciousness indeed only rests in itself always without any dependence.


Due to shining in itself, rest occurs. This supreme complete ego, which does not exist in the inert, is this.


Without touch of distinction, due to the absence of limitation, everything is established in this, like a city in a mirror.


How can distinction or limitation occur, indeed, by whom? Thus, the complete form's complete shining is established.


That indeed is said to be rest in one's own self and complete ego. This unbroken one essence indeed becomes as much, O Rāma.


In description, that appears in many forms, as much indeed is the freedom, since the power is that indeed.


Just as light and heat of fire exist inseparably, thus freedom and rest together are of one essence.


This indeed is the power called illusion, extremely difficult, which in form is like a mirror, of one essence with consciousness.


Even though appearing in many variations, the true form shines. Similarly, during shining, there is no deviation from the true form.


The appearance of limitation, which is said to be the appearance of the non-self, is ignorance, the inert power, the void, and nature.


Complete non-existence, space, darkness, the first creation, all that indeed is said to be the primary limitation.


O Rāma, the complete self, indeed, rests established. The misconception of partiality creates the appearance of space.


Therefore, the space of the self, which is devoid of self-conception, is said to be space. Indeed, that is the cause of samsara.


This indeed would be the distinction visible to the limited vision. O Rāma, with subtle vision, see the space that is seen by you.


The self of the collection of beings there is pure consciousness, as the space appears in other bodies, which is always your own.


That indeed would be their self, of the nature of dense consciousness and bliss. Thus, the form of consciousness remains pervaded by self-created space.


That indeed is called the mind, said to be the self, not otherwise. There, due to the primary nature of covering, the mind is called proof.


Due to the primary nature of covering, the knower is called the individual self. Thus, even though covered by space, the consciousness-self is indeed again.


In the soft, extremely loose, non-dense, pure space, through imaginations of hard and attached, dense and impure.


Reflecting elements, the embodied self, also covered by the body, shines like a lamp placed inside a pot, pervading the inside.


Thus, this only reflecting the inner body remains, like a hidden lamp, only illuminating the inside.


As the lamp's light goes out through the pot's hole, indeed, thus, consciousness goes out again through the openings of the senses.


Indeed, going out of consciousness does not exist due to its completeness and non-action. The self-covering space, the power of manifestation, is of the consciousness-self.


As long as one restrains, until then, the going out appears. This would be mental activity, the removal of the covering by manifestation.


Therefore, O Rāma, the mind is not different, indeed the self is called the mind. The moving consciousness named as mind, in the form of the unmoving self.


The removal of the covering by manifestation, indeed the movement of consciousness, O Rāma, this indeed would be imagination, in the absence of imagination.


Free from imagination, the complete form of knowledge, called liberation. O Rāma, abandon doubt here, in the absence of imagination.


Even the remaining covering would not exist, thus indeed, the covering is not true, because it is indeed imagined by oneself.


As in a fantasy, bound by some enemy, oneself being beaten and threatened, until imagination ceases.


Until then, the beating or threatening ceases; what remains there of bondage? Similarly, consider here also.


From beginningless time, O Rāma, here bondage does not exist for anyone. Giving up the delusion of a material self, consider what is this bondage.


This indeed is the great bondage, the certainty of bondage's reality. Like the false demon possession of a frightened child, it is situated.


As long as this delusion of bondage is not given up, even a wise person is not liberated from transmigration anywhere, despite great efforts.


What is this bondage, or how would it exist for the pure consciousness-self, conceived internally by reflections in the mirror of one's own self?


If bondage were like a fire reflection in a mirror that would burn, then belief in the reality of bondage and the certainty of the mind's existence would be true.


Without these two things, bondage does not exist for anyone anywhere. As long as these two things are sufficiently washed away by the great waters of true reflection.


Until then, without being washed away, in the destruction of transmigration, neither I, nor Brahma, nor Vishnu, nor Shankara.


Neither the embodiment of knowledge nor Tripura is capable by any means. Therefore, O Rāma, giving up these two, be happy.


Therefore, O Rāma, in the mind established in the form of non-duality, by the nature of the self alone, duality does not remain.


From the mind not shining in the form of "this" and "that," in giving up "this" and "that," the essence of shining alone remains.


The confusion of the rope and snake, considered true, in the form of the rope, indeed, the snake appears; thus, it is certain.


There, even in the negation of the snake, because of the support of the rope, from the form of consciousness, but other than the self, the knowledge of the rope would be established.


When the rope itself is imagined as a dream example of consciousness, in the negation of the rope, indeed, how would that knowledge remain, with what support?


Therefore, in the negation of the visible, that knowledge only remains as seeing. Because of non-separation from the consciousness-self, by that, how would there be duality?


Indeed, practical activity is seen as stable in dream objects. Dream objects are considered stable by all in a dream.


This much indeed is the difference in the perceptions of dream and waking: In waking, the certainty of the dream's falseness becomes definite.


In a dream, the certainty of the waking's falseness does not arise. This much alone would not determine the reality of waking activity.


As in waking, the stability and practical activity of objects are seen, is it seen thus in a dream or not? Tell.


In a dream, waking states do not appear, and dream states do not appear in waking. Practical activity or stability also do not appear similarly.


Consider with subtle vision, what is the difference between past and dream? See the stability and practical activity created by magic.


What, then, is only true, created by magic? The distinction between true and false is not known by ordinary people.


Therefore, the deluded ones say the world is true. O Rama, they declare it to be true, untouched by non-existence at any time.


Non-existence would be from non-appearance, indeed, but non-appearance is never of consciousness anywhere. Non-appearance is of the insentient, indeed, from the appearance of multiplicity.


Insentient states always appear as mutual non-existence. O Rama, consider when and where the non-appearance of consciousness would be.


When consciousness does not appear, then how would it appear? Tell. If it does not appear, how would it appear in non-appearance of the two?


O Rama, consciousness indeed appears; therefore, it is true. O Rama, listen, I briefly tell the distinction between true and false.


What appears independently would be true; other things would be false. Otherwise, the rope-snake and the like would also be true, indeed.


Negation, indeed, is knowledge of non-existence, and it would happen in its existence. In non-existence, knowledge of existence also happens clearly.


Therefore, the view that what is not negated is true and what is negated is false is not reasonable due to inconsistency in all ways.


In the non-appearance of consciousness, nothing would be, and that also would not be in all ways. Therefore, the logician mule who would say that consciousness does not appear...


He would say, "I am not." Thus, there, by whom, what is said? Whose doubt in the self would always be by the non-appearance of consciousness?


He would destroy the delusion of others by skillful arguments. Then, this rock would also destroy another's delusion.


Therefore, by the mere appearance of practical activity, there is not truth. All knowledge indeed is delusion, no doubt.


This great delusion in them is the certainty of non-delusion. Indeed, as delusion would first be from the knowledge of negation, thus.


All worldly knowledge is established as if non-delusion. Indeed, as the knowledge of silver from the knowledge of shell is of the nature of delusion.


Thus, from the knowledge of the consciousness self, all knowledge is of the nature of delusion. The delusion of the blue sky appears similarly to all.


This delusion of the waking state would be the cause of defects for all. Non-delusion, pure knowledge, is established as the consciousness self.


Thus, this which was asked by you has been spoken, consistent with reason. O Rama, abandon doubt here and determine what has been spoken.


How is the conduct of the liberated? This was asked before. I will explain that to you, O Rama. Listen attentively with concentration.


The liberated wise in the world are of three types: best, worst, and middling. They are afflicted moment by moment by experiences due to past karma.


Those who know their true nature, O Rama, are considered dull-witted if they do not recognize what comes from past karma even while experiencing it.


The middling wise are considered like those intoxicated by the taste of honey. They, too, are influenced by the varied fruits of numerous past actions.


They do not deviate from their true nature, nor are they perturbed by groups of calamities. They are neither amazed by wonders nor do they rejoice in great pleasures.


The best among the wise are inwardly peaceful and outwardly ordinary. Thus, by the difference in intellect and maturity of knowledge...


Due to the grandeur of remaining prārabdha, their conduct is varied. Their conduct may happen like that of one intoxicated by honey.
Chapter 19
Thus, having heard from the mouth of Dattatreya, the son of Bhrigu again asked about the conduct and works of the liberated, gradually.


O Lord, please explain to me in detail how the varied ripeness of knowledge arises due to differences in intellect.


Knowledge is indeed of one kind, consisting of the awareness of one's self alone. Isn't that the goal that which consists of its manifestation known as liberation?


How, then, can there be dependence on differences in ripeness by the difference in intellect? Do practices differ or not? Explain that.


Thus asked again by him, Dattatreya, the ocean of compassion, began to explain that matter in detail.


Listen, O Rama, I will explain this supreme secret. There is no difference in practice, and knowledge is not achieved through various practices.


The attainment of fruit varies by the gradation of practices. When the practice is complete, knowledge is effortlessly attained.


By the incompleteness of gradation, effort may be required. Essentially, no practice is utilized in knowledge.


Knowledge is not achievable anywhere, as it is accomplished by nature. Consciousness itself is knowledge, always self-luminous.


What need is there for practice for the eternally luminous nature? Consciousness is placed in the very pure casket of the mind.


Submerged in the mire of infinite impressions, it is not perceived. By the waters of restraint, the mire of impressions is properly cleansed.


By the sharp instrument of inquiry and with effort, in the casket of the mind, after a long time, assembled, O Rama, by proper reasoning, it is then opened.


Shining like a jewel, consciousness is perceived. Therefore, O Rama, practice is remembered in the removal of impressions alone.


Due to the presence of few or many impressions, the intellect becomes varied. As much as the flow of impressions covers the intellect, it remains.


The need for practice is as much as for the impressions covering one’s intellect, O son of Bhrigu. Varied impressions are said to be there; I will tell you the chief ones.


By the distinction of fault, action, and desire, that is threefold. Lack of faith is indeed the chief fault, destroying one's self.


Wrong perception is also indeed a fault of man. Mostly skilled in the arts also, not indeed free, due to fault.


By association with the good and scriptures, one does not know the supreme truth. The supreme truth which is without distinction does not exist, nor indeed comes into being.


It is not known by anyone, anywhere. Even having known the supreme truth, this truth does not become supreme.


From this knowledge, how can liberation arise, and so on, this debate exists in many ways? It is either wrong perception or indeed could be doubt.


Indeed, the fault of man, starting with impressions, is proclaimed here. Hundreds and thousands are skilled in scriptural knowledge.


O Rama, obstructed by this, they have attained the cycle of existence, previously driven by the force of bad impressions that remain in the intellect.


The impurity of teaching is an obstruction to acceptance. By which, even if correctly taught by teachers, it is not accepted, indeed.


The impression of actions is said to be difficult to overcome by restraint. Desire, with residual duty, may be endless with many branches.


Indeed, someone may count the waves in the ocean of Rama, the particles of earth, or the stars.


But indeed, even the desires of one person cannot be counted. This, O Rama, is the third fault, impression of desire said to you.


More expansive than the sky, more immovable than the mountain, this demon of hope, O Rama, which is the impression of desire.


Indeed, by this, all this world is situated like a madman. Burning by which, this world always cries out.


Some in the world, the most fortunate, by the refuge of the great mantra, are liberated. They shine, their limbs cool in all respects.


By these three impressions in the mind (fault, action, desire), O Rama, since the mind is overwhelmed, therefore, indeed, that truth does not shine.


Therefore, the destruction of impressions is the result of all practices. The first is indeed removed by the certainty of fault.


The second is removed by one birth, even by many births, by the grace of the Lord, not otherwise, even by millions of efforts.


The third is removed by proper practices like detachment. Detachment indeed arises by seeing the fault, not otherwise, ever.


Indeed, among these, by the distinction of small and great impressions, the expectation of small and great state arises, O Bhargava.


There, the first, the root of all, is the desire for liberation, not otherwise. Without the desire for liberation, hearing, reflection, etc., are not effective.


Not connected with the main fruit, it becomes only like a craft. The supreme state is not attained by mere knowledge of the craft.


Without the desire for liberation, by whom it is heard and properly reflected upon, all becomes in vain, like the decoration of a corpse.


In all respects, weak desire for liberation becomes in vain, O Rama, like the ordinary desire from hearing of fruit, does not bring fruit.


The desire arising after hearing of fruit does not bring the fruit of action. By hearing of fruit, who indeed, doesn’t have the desire for fruit, among living beings.


Therefore, from this superficial desire for liberation, there is indeed no fruit. As the desire for liberation may be intense, thus its fruit is quick.


The desire for liberation, which is most important, is sufficient among the practices. It indeed produces engagement and is said to be dedication.


As one whose entire body is severely burnt does not need coolness or anything else (seeing that it is vain), so when one desires liberation, they do not need anything else indeed in every way.


That desire for liberation becomes intense and capable of achieving the goal. This arises by seeing faults otherwise.


From the face of intense detachment, it gradually attains intensity. Indeed, detachment arises by seeing faults, which destroys attachment to objects.


By detachment, the desire for liberation becomes intense. Dedication arises, and with that dedication, engagement in practices is of extreme intensity.


By the nature of extreme intensity, one quickly attains the fruit. Hearing thus the words of Dattatreya, Bhargava again.


He asked, with a doubtful mind, a very great doubt, "O Lord, you have said that association with the good is the main cause.


The grace of the Lord, and also seeing faults, thus, what is the primary main cause, and how may one attain that?


Indeed, there is nothing without a cause, that is the certainty. So how may this happen without a cause? Tell me this in detail.


Thus asked, Dattatreya, the ocean of compassion, said to Rama, "O Bhargava, listen, I will tell you the supreme source of the supreme good."


The supreme consciousness, which is the goddess, by the power of her own freedom, reflects the picture of the world in herself, like a reflection in a mirror.


She, indeed, assuming the body called Hiranyagarbha, the supreme one, for the desire of welfare of beings covered by beginningless ignorance.


Illuminating the ocean of scriptures, fulfilling all desires, there, beings, by their nature, have various desires and tendencies.


Contemplating how there may be good for them, he created actions for desires with various fruits in every way.


A person does good or bad by nature. So, by some, that is due to attachment to the result of actions, indeed.


Wandering in various births, attaining human birth, under the influence of desires, one becomes inclined to actions for desires.


Especially, when one becomes devoted to the Lord due to desires, then, by association, one looks into the divine scriptures.


By hearing the fruits of actions for desires, engaged in actions for desires, obstructed due to not attaining the fruits, due to imperfection of subtle actions.


By curiosity about duty, one indeed approaches some noble person, and by association with him, sometimes hears about greatness.


Of the great Lord, then, by the maturation of previous merits, his engagement in pleasing the Lord may also be, O Bhargava.


Therefore, by the maturation of previous merits, attaining association with the good, one attains the series of steps leading to the supreme good, which is extremely rare.


Mostly, the attainment of the supreme good is stated to be rooted in association with the good, and sometimes by excellent merits or by excellent austerities.


One attains the supreme good suddenly, like the fall of a fruit from the sky. Therefore, due to the variety of causes, there is a variety in the attainment of the supreme good.


Similarly, by the difference in intelligence, by the gradation of tendencies, and by the gradation of practices, the state of the wise is varied.


By nature, whose intelligence has sparse tendencies, for him, indeed, with little practice, the attainment of knowledge happens enough.


Whose intelligence is pure by nature and has no tendencies at all, for him, with little cause, great knowledge happens.


Whose mind is extremely full of tendencies by nature, for him, even though knowledge arises, it appears to be covered.


By that, indeed, achieved again, after a long time, attains completeness. Therefore, the state of the wise is seen to be varied.


By the difference in the maturity of the mind, O descendant of Bhrigu, the difference in state is seen. Therefore, due to the gradation of covering by tendencies in intelligence.


Knowledge is observed to be different, indeed, similarly, the difference in state is. O Rama, see the difference in state among the wise.


Indeed, those who know their nature, such as Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesha, see their difference in state by the qualities born of their nature.


In any way, it is not possible to say  that their knowledge has impurity. The greatness of qualities born of nature is indeed different still.


Just as the body of the wise, being fair, does not become dark, similarly, the nature of the mind also does not assume another state.


O Rama, similarly, see us, the wise sons of Atri, such as Durvasa, Chandra, and me, having attained different states.


See Vasistha, engaged in duties, and such renunciates as Sanaka, who are angry, desirous, and renounce all marks of identity.


See Narada, absorbed in devotion, praising, and Bhrigu, residing with the demon party, the preceptor resorting to the gods.


See Vyasa, eloquent and dedicated to scripture creation, and also king Janaka, and Bharata, the renunciant.


See the different states of the wise by nature, and also others. I will tell you the secret, listen, O son of Bhargava.


The threefold tendencies which are said previously, the second among them is born of actions, in the form of delusion, that is greater among all.


Whose mind has no trace of that, indeed they are intelligent, free from fault, their tendencies of desire and others are gone.


By practice, those who have knowledge without obstacles, for them, dispassion and others are not required.


For them, again, neither contemplation nor meditation is required. By mere hearing once, contemplation and meditation occur.


At that time, having slightly attained, they become liberated while living, knowing the supreme state without doubt, like Janaka and others.


By contrary practice, indeed, they have not destroyed the tendencies of desire and others completely, which are subtle, by pure-minded ones.


Therefore, by them, even in that liberated state known, the previously existing tendencies of desire and others continue as before, continuously.


But, there is not even a little taint on their intellect by them (tendencies). Indeed, they are called liberated and highly regarded by the wise.


O Rama, indeed, the mind which is very deluded by tendencies of actions, for this mind knowledge does not come anywhere, even if spoken by Shiva.


Connected with strong offenses, to them knowledge does not come in any way, whose tendencies are in the form of offenses and actions.


O descendant of Bhrigu, his small tendencies, even if desire-oriented, become abundant by abundant hearing, and similarly by contemplation and meditations.


Knowledge arises over a long time with great difficulty; but his practice is small there by due to the intensity of practice.


If the mind becomes almost destroyed due to the absence of tendencies, indeed, such knowledgeable ones are called middle, whose mind is destroyed.


Indeed, for some of them, due to lack of intensity in practice, the mind, with sparse tendencies, does not become destroyed.


But they are called those possessing dull knowledge, still having a mind, indeed, only those possessing only knowledge are liberated while living, as well as others.


Indeed, those possessing only knowledge, experiencing visible suffering, become bound by prarabdha karma, they are called having liberation at the end of the body.


Those whose mind is destroyed are said to have transcended prarabdha karma. In the field of the mind, the seed of prarabdha karma becomes the sprout of experience.


Due to the absence of the field of the mind, that prarabdha karma, over time, perishes like a rootless seed without potency.


Just as an exceedingly intelligent person can simultaneously perform ten or five actions somewhere without faltering.


Moreover, such people are seen endowed with skill in action, performing multiple activities simultaneously like walking, speaking, and doing.


In this case, with one mind, how can there be threefold action? And how does the teacher observe the many students simultaneously?


O Rama, who was your enemy, Arjuna, the lord of the Haihayas, who improperly followed the distinction of letters and was established in their differentiation, was slain.


With a thousand arms, he fought simultaneously with many weapons separately, without faltering anywhere, indeed seen by you, the wise one.


Their mind, becoming multifaceted, following the respective sequence, accomplishes many kinds of actions, likewise indeed, surely.


Similarly, the highest knowers' self-perception, even when externally directed, always remains undisturbed; they are said to have many minds.


That prarabdha karma, sprouted separately in the field of the mind, becomes burnt by the fire of knowledge each time, again and again.


The sprout of the prarabdha seed has a union of pleasure and pain; reflection on that is said to be the fruit. Wherefrom does the fruit come from a burnt sprout?


Their interaction becomes through gathered insights and recollections, just as a mature person is seen playing with a child.


Like an elephant is pleased or distressed in the destruction of stone by the elephant, thus they rejoice and grieve in actions, those with many minds.


As there is no internal joy or agitation for the one engaged in particular action, thus their conduct is equal and stable everywhere.


For the intelligent and knowledgeable ones, due to the absence of the practice of opposing tendencies, the destruction of tendencies occurs.


Due to the absence of destruction of previous tendencies, the continuation becomes thus; some are devoted to actions, others are desirous and angry.


The highest and knowledgeable ones shine, devoted to various practices. There, indeed, the one with a steady mind is described as a slow-witted person.


By him also, all knowledge is determined as false. In self-realization, nothing at all shines in samadhis.


Samadhi is indeed the reflection of the true nature; nothing else is said to be so. The state of non-duality, as the foundation of all, always.


It certainly shines in all, and in non-shining, there is nothing at all. Likewise, it shines free from thoughts in the stated states.


By that much, samadhi is not achieved by all, indeed, O Bhargava. But, only those who are connected with that reflection are remembered.


Even the consciousness engrossed in worldly dealings is devoid of knowables, known as the sky's blueness is seen again.


Known as false, the consciousness is not connected with that; otherwise, there would be no difference between truth and untruth.


Likewise, grasping the unreal, there is no connection in knowledge somewhere; thus indeed, it is certainly stated for the wise.


Consciousness becomes devoid of knowables due to the shining of the negated, especially of the mindless, because that is the state of unmani.


Where the mind is still, that is said to be the state of unmani; the movement of the mind would be the connection with the true knowable.


These states are simultaneously established in the highest wise ones; he is always both active and in samadhi, O Bhargava.


Therefore, even his consciousness is established devoid of the knowable; thus, this has been said as asked by you before.
Chapter 20
Here, I will narrate to you what happened in ancient times. Listen, long ago, in the assembly of Brahma, in the very pure highest realm.


A discussion of knowledge took place, with subtle and deeper deliberation. Present were Sanaka and others, Vasistha, Pulastya, Pulaha, and Kratu.


Present were Bhrigu, Atri, Angiras, Praceta, Narada, Cyavana, Vamadeva, Visvamitra, and Gautama.


Present were Sukra, Parashara, Vyasa, Kanva, Kashyapa, Daksha, Sumantu, Shankha, Likhita, and Devala.


Thus, other groups of sages and the best among royal sages all gathered there in the grand assembly of Brahma.


The deliberation was performed very intensely, with subtle explanations. The sages there asked Brahma.


O Lord, we knowers of the highest and the lowest in the world see various states of the enlightened ones due to differences in nature.


Some are always absorbed in samadhi, some are engaged in deliberation, others are immersed in devotion, and others still rest on imperishable actions.


But some are engrossed in worldly dealings, like outward-facing men. Among them, who is better? This you should tell us.


We know our own standpoint to be better, O Lord. Thus asked, Brahma said, thinking of their unsettled minds.


O great sages, I do not know this entirely. Therefore, the omniscient Supreme Lord would know this matter.


Let us go there to ask, thus having said, he went there with them, meeting the Lord of Lords, they united with Vishnu.


Brahma, the creator of the world, asked that question of the chief sages. Having heard the question, Shiva, knowing the intention of Brahma's mind.


Thinking of the unsettled minds of the sages, the god thought, "Even if I say something here, it would indeed be useless."


Thinking that the sages, filled with disbelief, would know due to their own standpoint, Maheshwara, the Lord of Lords, replied.


Listen, O sages, I do not even know this clearly. Therefore, let us meditate on the divine knowledge, the Supreme Goddess.


By her grace, we will know even the hidden meaning thereafter. Thus spoken, all the sages, along with Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva.


They meditated on the knowledge of Maheshani, Tripura, embodying consciousness. Thus, all meditated upon Tripura, embodying consciousness.


The Supreme, composed of consciousness and space, composed of sound, appeared. There was a deep sound like that of thunder in the sky.


Let the sages speak, what did you meditate upon and quickly desire? Indeed, for some of my devotees, the desired does not fail.


Having heard the supreme words, the best of sages bowed down. Then, Brahma and others praised with various hymns.


Then the group of sages spoke that knowledge of Tripureshwari. Salutation to you, O great Goddess, O sacred knowledge, O ruler of Tripura.


You are the creator of all, sustainer in oneself, dissolver of all, O Supreme Goddess, salutation to you.


You are ever new because there is no birth for you. You are ever fresh because there is no old age for you.


You are all, the essence of all, omniscient, delighting all. You are not all, not going everywhere, without essence, not omniscient, not delighting all.


O Goddess, again salutation to you in front, behind, below, above, at the sides, in all directions, repeated salutations to you.


Tell what your other form, power, and knowledge are. The result, means, primary practitioner, and perfected one.


Tell the supreme state of perfection and the best among the perfected ones, O Goddess. Again, repeated salutations to you.


Thus asked, the great knowledge began to explain, being compassionate to the group of sages, with clear meaning and supreme words.


Listen, O sages, I will explain everything in sequence. I give you the nectar extracted from the ocean of scriptures.


Where all this world, like a reflection in a mirror, arises, is situated, and dissolves, always shines for all.


Which indeed shines as the world-like form for those unaware of the Self, which shines without distinction for yogis in the Self alone.


Which is like the deep, still ocean, unshaken illumination, which is worshipped by great devotees with great love, free from deceit.


Knowing naturally the sweet place of nature, even with a sense of differentiation, it is worshipped by those extremely devoted.


The thread of life within the senses and inner faculties, in the absence of which there would be nothing, as indicated by the scriptures.


The supreme brilliance of the goddess, the supreme form, spoken by me, beyond and above many universes, in the ocean of nectar.


In the island of jewels, in the kadamba forest, in the gem mansion, on the throne composed of five Brahmas, is the form of Tripurasundari.


The beginningless pair called Aparā, O lords of sages, and Sadashiva and Ishana, Brahma, Vishnu, and three-eyed Shiva.


Ganesha, Skanda, the guardians of directions, the powers, the hosts of deities, demons, gods, serpents, yakshas, kimpurushas, and others.


All my forms called Aparā are said to be worshipped. But deluded by my illusion, they do not know me everywhere.


I alone, being worshipped by all, give the desired result. There is no one else other than me who is worthy of worship or a bestower of fruits.


As one meditates upon me, one obtains my result. My power, O group of sages, is declared as infinite.


Without depending on anything, I, the non-dual consciousness, manifest as the infinite worlds, O best of sages.


Thus, even though manifesting always, I do not leave the form of non-dual consciousness. This is my primary power, the difficult-to-comprehend visualization.


O sages, see my power with subtle vision. I am the support of all, pervading all, and remain alone.


By my own illusion, not knowing myself, I have wandered for a long time. Knowing my own self again, I have attained the state of a disciple of the guru.


Always liberated, I become liberated again and again. I create this world without material cause.


Such as these, there are many series of my powers. It is not possible to count them even with a thousand mouths.


Listen, I will briefly explain my power in part. This varied journey of the world is spread everywhere.


My knowledge is of various kinds, from distinctions like duality and non-duality, and from distinctions of higher and lower. Its results are also varied in many ways.


Knowledge of duality is indeed various, depending on the second. It is said that meditation on it is similar to dream realms.


That is also fruitful, to be known by regulation, because it is fixed. Another is also varied, and the main one is indeed that.


The said meditation of main and secondary, the primary result sequence, is indeed the non-dual knowledge, declared as higher knowledge.


Without worshipping me, the supreme, for a long time, how can the supreme glorious knowledge called non-dual be attained?


That non-dual knowledge is indeed the supreme consciousness alone, whose pure state realization overpowers duality realization.


When the mind attains its own self alone, it indeed becomes illuminated knowledge, O best of sages.


The illumination of the pure self from scripture or reasoning, and the destruction of the appearance of body and such as self, is called knowledge.


That indeed becomes knowledge by which anything, even though shining anywhere, does not appear in any way.


That indeed is non-dual knowledge by which anything would not be unknown at any time, even a little.


The essence of all knowledge, which would be knowledge indeed, that is indeed non-dual knowledge, the supreme, O best of ascetics.


When such knowledge arises, doubts gathered from ignorance dissolve like clouds by the wind. Indeed, that is supreme.


All impressions of desires in which nothing remains are like a toothless snake. That knowledge is remembered as supreme.


The result of knowledge is the dissolution of all sufferings. The attainment of complete fearlessness is called liberation.


Fear arises from the conception of duality. Where would be the conception of duality when non-duality is firmly known, like darkness at sunrise?


Sages do not have fear anywhere in the absence of the conception of duality. Therefore, whatever other result would be, that fear would be in every way.


The second is indeed finite, observed more in the world. In every way, finite fear exists. Therefore, where would be fearlessness?


Union ends in separation in every way. Result union also perishes. Thus, it is certain.


As long as other results are stated, fear is described as much. But that result, in the form of fearlessness, is declared by all.


When the result of the self, non-other, is declared as liberation, and when the knower, knowledge, and object of knowledge also become one.


Then indeed is the supreme liberation, devoid of all fear. Knowledge free from doubts and deliberations, devoid of ignorance.


The clear self-nature of the knower is initially not perceived. Therefore, the teacher and scripture are perceivers, not otherwise.


This indeed is said to be the nature of what is to be known, as long as the difference between the knower, knowledge, and the known appears.


As long as the difference among the knower, knowledge, and the known appears, there is no knower, knowledge, or the known. When the difference is dissolved, they are mutually established.


Then, the attainment of the knower, knowledge, and the known is indeed remembered as this result. Up to the result of the knower, knowledge, and the known, in reality, there is no difference.


For the sake of worldly conduct, the difference is assumed there. Therefore, there is no unprecedented result to be obtained here.


The self indeed appears as knower, knowledge, and known by illusion. As long as it appears, worldly existence would be like a mountain.


When somehow this appears free from difference, worldly existence would dissolve like cut clouds by the wind.


For such great liberation, devotion to that is indeed the means. In complete devotion to that, no other means is desired.


In incomplete devotion to that, what use are thousands of good means? Therefore, devotion to that is indeed the main means of liberation.


In every way, the state of "I accomplish this" with devotion to that. Who is connected with devotion to that is indeed liberated by nature.


Liberation may come in days, months, years, or another birth, depending on the purity of intellect and the duration involved, whether short or long.


In the intellect, indeed, there are many faults destructive of all meanings, by which people are constantly tormented in the terrible cycle of existence.


Among them, the first is lack of faith, the second is desire tendencies, and the third is dullness; thus, the collection of faults is said to be of three types.


Lack of faith is of two kinds: doubt and misconception. The first doubt is whether liberation exists or not.


The first misconception here is that liberation does not exist. These two, doubt and misconception, are the primary obstacles in devotion.


These two, doubt and misconception, would gradually be destroyed by contrary determination. The primary means here is cutting the root, and there is no other.


The root of lack of faith is contrary reasoning. Abandoning that and establishing correct reasoning.


Contrary determination, preceded by root cutting, then by the rise of faith, destroys lack of faith.


Desire and other tendencies in the intellect obstruct hearing. An intellect filled with desire and other tendencies indeed does not function.


In the world, even a desirous person always focused on the desired does not see what is placed before and does not hear what is spoken in hearing.


Thus, for one filled with desire and others, the heard is like the unheard. Therefore, conquer desire and other tendencies by the wealth of dispassion.


There are thousands of tendencies like desire, anger, and others. Among them, desire is fundamental; in its destruction, nothing remains.


Therefore, by the connection with dispassion, destroy the desire tendencies. Hope, indeed, is said to be desire, situated as "this should be mine."


In the possible, it is gross, and in the impossible, it is subtle. By the practice of firm dispassion, one should destroy all of them.


There, the root is the contemplation of the faults of desires every moment. Disinterest in the objects and destroying the tendencies, thus.


The third intellect fault, which is situated in the form of dullness, is incurable by practices in every way, O best of sages.


By which even heard with devotion, the intellect does not rise, that dullness is indeed a great fault, destroyer of purpose.


There, except for service to the self-god, there is no other cause. By the gradation of service, I remove its dullness.


By nature, whether little or great dullness, immediately or in another birth, the attainment of its result would be of one with dull intellect.


All the wealth of practices, by my devotion indeed, attains; and who is always by devotion without deceit, attains to me.


He who quickly removes obstacles to practice becomes successful; the one who honors me, the Lord, who expands all intellects.


Neglecting, if one is only focused on practice due to ignorance, he may be obstructed at every step and may or may not attain the fruit.


Therefore, sages, primary intention should be the practice. Thus, one with intention is remembered as the supreme practitioner.


There, the practitioner endowed with my devotion is respected by all. Accomplishment is self-realization and the thought that the body is not the self.


The thought of selfhood is certainly situated in the body, etc. Its mere negation is accomplishment free from ignorance.


The self is determined by all, but not as the pure self. Therefore, indeed, a great series of misfortunes is attained.


Therefore, pure consciousness which illuminates the body, etc., determining this as the pure self, removes all doubts.


Accomplishment is this, thus said by the wise; not any other accomplishment than this. Accomplishments like the ability to move in the sky, becoming small, and others, indeed.


Self-knowledge accomplishment does not deserve even a sixteenth part of those. All those accomplishments are limited by space and time.


This should be unlimited self-knowledge of auspicious nature. Only those are all well established in the practices of self-knowledge.


These are obstacles in the practice of self-knowledge. What is desired with those like magical accomplishments?


For one whose state of Brahman is directly equivalent to straw, how many of these accomplishments are indeed causes of wasting time?


Therefore, accomplishment should be from self-knowledge, not otherwise. By which the complete destruction of sorrow happens and is full of bliss.


That only is the accomplishment, not otherwise, freeing from the grasp of death. This self-knowledge accomplishment is by different kinds of practices.


Briefly, by the difference in the purity of intellect and the difference in ripening, there are threefold: best, medium, and inferior.


In the world, the activities of the twice-born are reciting the Vedas, by intellect, and by great practice, are involved in hundreds of activities.


Even the Vedic knowledge, recited with unbroken letters, is best, for the concentrated one in activities than of the unconcentrated one.


Even like before, recited with unbroken letters, Vedic knowledge, for the medium one, who is always studied thus only by the practice of investigation.


The Vedic knowledge, recited extremely with unbroken letters, is indeed not grasped, for the inferior. Thus only, the self-knowledge accomplishment is threefold, O sages.


When taking up great activities, one may be engaged without interruption, or at another time, with some interruption, however, is always united.


Depending on that, there may be states of less and more: best, medium, and inferior. Here, only the best is designated as the supreme limit of accomplishment.


When there is a supreme state even in dreams and other states, that accomplishment, equal to a moment of contemplation, is supreme.


When engagement in all activities, with effort through awareness of impressions, is declared as the supreme limit of accomplishment.


When the supreme state in the sensitive self is without effort and uninterrupted, then accomplishment has reached its limit.


When engaged in activities, one sees that state but does not see duality, then that accomplishment has attained completeness.


When one acts in waking, etc., like sleeping, then that state of accomplishment has attained completeness.


Thus, having attained accomplishment, he is called the best among the accomplished. Always engaged in activities, he does not abandon meditation.


Sometimes even the wise are considered the best among the accomplished. He always knows the various states of the wise.


By self-experience alone, he is considered the best among the accomplished. He has no trace of doubt or desire.


Fearless in activities, he is considered the best among the accomplished. He knows all happiness, sorrow, and worldly activities.


Knowing in oneself, he is considered the best among the accomplished. He sees the self as both extremely bound and liberated.


He who sees all souls in oneself is considered the best among the accomplished. He always sees the webs of bondage clearly in oneself.


He who does not expect liberation anywhere is considered the best among the accomplished. I am the best of the accomplished here, and there is no difference between me and him anywhere.


Indeed, sages have clearly said this with reasoning. Knowing this spoken by me, one is not deluded anywhere.


Thus, having said this, the supreme knowledge ceased, O descendant of Bhṛgu. Having heard this, all the sages removed their doubts.


Having bowed to Shiva and the other lords of the world, they went each to their own abode. This Song of Knowledge, destroyer of the multitude of sins, has been spoken to you by me.


Heard and properly considered, this very excellent Song of Knowledge, bestower of self-sovereignty, is directly described as knowledge.


For those who read daily, pleased, she bestows knowledge herself. In the ocean of worldly darkness, she becomes a boat for those who are sinking.
Chapter 21
Having heard thus, Rama, the descendant of Bhṛgu, who was deluded by the net of ignorance, became nearly liberated after listening to the sage Dattatreya.


Again, he asked Atri's son, having bowed with devotion, "O Lord, tell me the well-ascertained means to knowledge."


Tell me the essential, easy, and directly fruit-giving means, and the characteristics of the wise by which I will quickly know them.


How do the wise maintain their state in union and separation from the body, and how do they conduct themselves with an unattached mind?


With great kindness, please clearly tell me all this. Thus, Atri's son was asked by Jamadagni's son.


Pleased, the ocean of compassion addressed Bhārgava (Rama) and said, "Listen, Rama, I will tell you the secret means to knowledge."


The principal means to knowledge is the supreme grace of the deity, which is approached with all emotions as one's own deity.


It is certain that for him, knowledge becomes very easy. This is stated as the highest means to knowledge, Rama.


This is capable of achieving results independently of others. Without this, nothing else here can properly give fruit.


Listen here to the reason, Rama. This is with reason. Knowledge, which is pure consciousness, illuminates everything.


The imagined covering of its illuminating nature, but by inquiry and removal, leads to the realization of its true nature.


And that is very difficult for others who are focused on external things, but for devotees who abandon otherness and focus on devotion, it becomes easy.


Indeed, it is well ascertained that for one devoted to the deity, it becomes easy and quickly attainable, requiring little other means.


Knowing oneself somehow, one should describe it to others. Describing it always, Rama, one attains absorption.


Thus, through description and firm absorption, attaining the state of Shiva, the mind becomes free from joy and sorrow.


Wherever he goes, all that is consecrated to Shiva. The highest knower, established in the state of liberation, does this.


Therefore, with great devotion, explain this again to others. This is the best means; there is no other equal to this.


With devotion, there is no other means equal to explanation. The characteristics of the wise, Rama, are indeed difficult to understand.


Because it is all inner and not perceptible to the eye, speech, etc., it is not possible to describe or write it anywhere by others.


As the knowledge of scriptures is not known by others in the world through body, clothes, ornaments, etc., similarly, it is not known by others.


Wisdom is known only by self-awareness and not otherwise, just as the knowledge of flavor is known by tasting it, O Bhārgava.


Still, by the wise and learned, it is known by their speech, just as the path is known by tiny ants.


There are gross characteristics that are many-sided, but the subtle characteristics are difficult to comprehend by others.


The description, speech, and demonstration of practice, like the wise, are seen to be possible by others as well.


The means to knowledge, practiced by those with impure hearts, becomes firm for them. This is stated as their characteristic.


Know him as the highest among the wise, for whom honor and dishonor, gain and loss, victory and defeat are not slightly distinguishable.


The highest among the wise is he who, when asked about self-experiences, replies instantly and without doubt, even with hidden meanings.


The characteristic of the wise is the one who has extreme enthusiasm in discussions of knowledge and does not avoid explaining it.


He is the highest among the wise who, by nature, does not initiate actions, is content, has a pure mind, and remains peaceful even in great calamities.


Such characteristics, O best of Bhārgava, are stable in the self-examination of the wise, without a doubt.


The seeker should always be dedicated to self-examination, just as he skillfully engages in examining others.


Thus, examining oneself, how can one not attain success? When dedicated to non-examination of others' virtues and faults.


When one is dedicated to examining one's own virtues and faults, then by attaining all means, one attains success.


Thus, O son of Bhṛgu, the stated characteristics of the wise are always useful in self-examination.


But in the examination of others, these are many-sided. Because the wise who are extremely pure-hearted, O best of Bhṛgu.


Their success is established by seemingly perfect means. Therefore, they follow past tendencies and engage in activities.


How can they, with ordinary conduct, be examined? But the wise do their examination by the power of practice.


Like jewel examiners by superficial observation, those with body consciousness are like fools to the dull-witted.


Because they do not attain natural meditation, as long as they are engaged in inquiry, they remain full in form.


When turned away from inquiry, then due to body consciousness, experiencing pleasure and pain, they remain extremely like animals.


Even though they attain satisfaction intermittently by reaching a state of completeness, their animal-like state lies between true reflections.


Like a burnt rope does not bind, when the edges of the cloth are dyed with lac, it appears decorated.


By spreading, even the middle of the cloth becomes entirely dyed red. Thus, his activity is centered in the midst of consciousness.


Having attained unity with the form of consciousness, she does not become bound. The association with the body does not exist for the middle-wise at all.


Identification with the body is said to be association with the body by the wise. That does not exist for the middle-wise ever, O Rāma.


By excessive practice, his mind is always absorbed. His activity is not there, as his mind is always composed.


Even the maintenance of his body is like deep sleep. Just as someone in deep sleep sometimes acts only by tendencies.


Saying or doing something, he does not know anything afterwards, just as a drunk person does not know what he speaks or does.


Thus, this great yogi, beyond worldly activities, sometimes does something but does not know it again.


But the body always functions by past tendencies. For the highest wise one, even the body does not exist.


He performs activities like a charioteer, situated as if with a chariot, doing actions but not being the body of the chariot.


Just so, the charioteer would be engaged in body activities, not the body nor the actor, but of pure consciousness.


With an inner pure mind, he acts externally as one dressed as a woman in a play, assuming a dual role.


As an adult playing with a child is free from being a child, thus, this one engaged in the play of the world is pure-hearted.


The middle-wise, by excellence of restraint, achieve a steady state. The steady state is by the excellence of inquiry.


By the ripening of wisdom, there is a difference between the middle and the highest. Here, listen to the conversation between the wise, I will tell you.


Formerly, there was a king named Ratnāṅgada, the lord of the mountain. He resided near the Vipāśā river, in a city named Amṛtā.


He had two great sons, wise and steadfast, Rukmāṅgada and Hemāṅgada, very dear to their father.


Rukmāṅgada was deeply knowledgeable of the scriptures, and Hemāṅgada became highly wise, the highest among the wise.


Both of them, surrounded by all their armies, went out for hunting in the spring, entering the dense forest.


Having killed many deer, tigers, hares, and buffaloes, and extremely exhausted, they reached and stayed by the lake.


On the other side of the lake, under the banyan tree, the Brahma Rakshasa, a knower of all scriptures, abundantly debates with scholars.


For a long time, he remains eating the defeated ones, Rukmangada, curious about the debate, heard from the speech.


Having gone there with his brother, he engaged in debate, was defeated in the debates, and captured by the Brahma Rakshasa.


Rukmangada captured, seeing that, Hemangada said to him, "O Brahma Rakshasa, you do not deserve to eat him."


Defeating me, his younger brother, then eat us together. Hearing Hemangada's words, the Brahma Rakshasa said.


Food I’ve obtained after a long time, hunger troubles me. With this meal done, I will debate with you.


Then, defeating you also, by eating, I will be extremely satisfied. Thus is my decision, O king.


This boon obtained for a long time from the great soul Vasishta, once his disciple came and was eaten.


Named Devarata, I was then cursed by the great soul, from hereafter, eating a human, O Brahma Rakshasa.


Your face will be burnt, thus the sage said. Afterwards, requested again by me, granted to me an excellent boon.


In debates, defeated mortals you eat entirely, thus, I eat those defeated in debate.


After a long time, this food is obtained by me, abundant everyway. Having eaten, then in debate, I will defeat you, O king.


Thus said, ready to eat, again Hemangada said, "O Brahma Rakshasa, hear my well-requested words."


Even after something obtaining, how can you release him, speak that to me. Giving you that, I will release my brother.


Thus spoken, he said again to the king, the Brahma Rakshasa, "Listen, O king, there is indeed something by which I release him."


Who would leave food dear to life as the time approaches? But there is one condition of mine, some questions situated in my heart.


If you answer my questions, I will release  your brother. Then Hemangada said, "Ask them, I will answer you."


Thus spoken, the Brahma Rakshasa asked the prince, hidden questions in order. "I will speak that, listen, O Bhargava."


What might be spread from the sky, more subtle than the smallest, what form does it take, where is it situated? Tell this, O prince.


Consciousness is spread from the sky, subtler than the smallest particle, sparkling in form, residing within the self. Listen, O Brahma Rakshasa.


How can one, even very spread, be subtler? What is the sparkling nature and what is the self? Tell this, O prince.


Due to causation, it is spread, subtle due to intangibility, and also the self is sparkling consciousness. Listen, O Brahma Rakshasa.


What is the place of realization, and how is it obtained? By realization, what may it be? Tell this, O prince.


The intellect's place in realization is obtained by concentration. By realization, birth may not be. Listen, O Brahma Rakshasa.


What is this intellect of yours called, and what kind of concentration is that? What may be birth also? Tell this, O prince.


Consciousness covered by inertia, the intellect may be, concentration rests in the self. Birth is body-consciousness intellect. Listen, O Brahma Rakshasa.


Why is there no realization of consciousness, and by what is it obtained? How is birth obtained? Tell this, O prince.


From lack of discernment, realization is not obtained by the self. Birth is from the ego of doership. Listen, O Brahma Rakshasa.


What is lack of discernment, as you say? What is the self? What is the ego of doership? Tell this, O prince.


Lack of discernment is distinct knowledge, ask self in the self. That tendency of self-importance ego may be. Listen, O Brahma Rakshasa.


By what is lack of discernment destroyed, and what is its cause? What is the cause of that also? Tell this, O prince.


By contemplation, it is destroyed indeed. Dispassion is its cause. The cause of that is fault-seeing. Listen, O Brahma Rakshasa.


What may be contemplation, and what is called dispassion? What is said to be fault-seeing? Tell this, O prince.


By examination of the seer and the seen, its abandonment in the seen, understanding of pain in the seen, is indeed. Listen, O Brahma Rakshasa.


By what may all this be, and from what is it obtained? There, what may be the cause? Tell this, O prince.


By the grace of the deity, all is accomplished by devotion. The cause is indeed good company. Listen, O Brahma Rakshasa.


What is the deity called, and what is said to be devotion? What kind of good people are said to be? Tell this, O prince.


The deity is the world sustainer, and devotion is said to be dedication to that. Good people are peaceful and compassionate. Listen, O Brahma Rakshasa.


Who always fears in the world, who is always focused on sorrow, and who is always full of dejection? Tell this, O prince.


The very wealthy one is always fearful, and the one with a large family is sorrowful. One engulfed by desires is always miserable. Listen, O Brahma Rakshasa.


Who may be fearless in the world, and who may be without sorrow? Who may always be without dejection? Tell this, O prince.


The fearless one is free from attachment, without sorrow is one with a conquered mind, (without misery is) knower of the known, the self of oneself. Listen, O Brahma Rakshasa.


Who may be hard to perceive in the world, and who is seen without a body? What is the action of the inactive? Tell this, O prince.


The liberated while living is indeed hard to perceive, he is without a body, even having a body. His actions are those of the inactive. Listen, O Brahma Rakshasa.


What exists and what does not exist in the world? Who may be absolutely impossible? Having said thus, O king, I’ll release the elder brother quickly.


The seer exists, indeed the seen does not exist. The transactions of the world are indeed impossible. This is said. O Brahma Rakshasa, release my brother quickly.


Having heard this, the Brahma Rakshasa, satisfied, released Rukmangada. Then afterwards, he indeed became a Brahmin.


Seeing the radiant embodiment of penance in the form of a Brahmin, the princes asked with doubt, "Who are you?"


Then the foremost Brahmin told his own story as it was. "I was formerly a Brahmin, well-known in Magadha."


"Famous as Vasuman, expert in all scriptures, I defeated many in assemblies, again and again, proud of my knowledge."


"Scholars by the hundreds, Brahmins, then I became extremely proud. Once, in the assembly of the king of Magadha, a sage named Ashtaka..."


"Knower of the higher and lower, completely tranquil, for debate, I met him. Skilled solely in dry logic, inquiring into self-knowledge."


"Then I challenged him only with logical arguments. His words of resolution were well-supported by many scriptures."


"Criticizing with webs of logic, I became focused on insults. Even insulted many times by me, in the assembly of the king."


"He was calm and silent. Then his disciple, the great soul Kashyapa, cursed me out of anger, in the assembly of the king."


"Teacher, you insult my teacher inappropriately, lowest of the twice-born. Since therefore, for a long time, you will become a Brahma Rakshasa."


"Cursed thus by him, greatly frightened, I, trembling, bowing, quickly took refuge in the sage Ashtaka."


"To me, then he showed compassion, even to the opponent, the calm-minded. He gave an end to the curse for me. Listen attentively to that."


"The questions made by you to me, and answered by me indeed, those established solely by logic, when that one will answer."


"Some wise one will liberate you from the curse then. Today you are freed from that curse after a long time, O prince."


"That, you I consider a great soul, knower of the known, best among men." Thus spoken by him, the Brahmin, the prince became astonished.


Then again the prince, questioned entirely by him, enlightening Vasuman completely, went to his own city.


Bowing to Vasuman, accompanied by brothers and soldiers, this all is told to you, what was asked by you, O Bhargava.
Chapter 22
Having heard the story of the Rakshasa, Rama, the scion of Bhrigu's clan, with humility, asked the lord of the avadhutas again.


O Lord, what was asked by the curse-freed Brahmin, and what did Hemangada say? Kindly tell this to me.


I am greatly curious about this, and it is not a small matter. Thus asked again, compassionate Dattatreya said.


O Rama, I will tell you that which was spoken with great meaning. Then Vasuman asked Hemangada, who was present.


O prince, I ask you something, you answer. I learned that at first from the yogi Ashtaka.


Again, by your words, the supreme state is completely known. But how is the state of the knower of truth?


How can the state of the well-known, of the knower, be dedicated to actions, be like the state of darkness and light together?


O prince, tell this to me correctly as it is. Thus asked, Hemangada said to him, the best of Brahmins.


O Brahmin, your delusion is even now not completely destroyed. By actions, how is knowledge, which is self-existent, obstructed?


If knowledge is obstructed by actions, then how is the gain of human goals possible by sleep-like knowledge?


All actions, even this, may rely on knowledge. How is that knowledge obstructed by that? Explain this to me.


Knowledge is indeed where this world shines. By resolve, all actions indeed shine in knowledge.


Without resolve, observing that form by intellect once, one becomes accomplished, free from bondage. Thus, it is well-determined.


Therefore, O Brahmin, your question is not approved by the wise. Again, Vasuman said to the prince, "O great one."


Truth, O prince, this is also well-determined by me. True nature is indeed awareness without thoughts, as it is said here.


With thoughts, having attained, where is not delusion again? Indeed, thoughts are delusion, like a snake in the rope.


Listen, O Brahmin, you do not know the distinction between delusion and non-delusion. The sky appears blue even to those who know.


They sometimes act saying the sky is blue. But by that knowledge, it is not called delusion.


To the ignorant, however, that is delusion; to the knower of truth, that is indeed true knowledge. That knowledge is like a dead great snake without authority or living.


The action of the reflection in the mirror may be the same for the knowledgeable and the ignorant. But therefore, there is a difference between them.


For the wise, that knowledge is indeed true knowledge; but for the ignorant, it is delusion. For the wise, knowledge is indeed worldly transactions in all aspects.


By seeing the worldly transactions, as mirror reflections, they are equal for the knowledgeable. Therefore, again, there is no arising of delusion.


That born of ignorance is only removed by knowledge. Why does the fault-born ignorance dissolve by mere knowledge?


Therefore, indeed, the one with defective sight sees duality even when knowing. This world appearance arises from the fault of action.


Therefore, worldly transactions do not dissolve into non-action. When action is completed, non-dual consciousness remains.


Therefore, there is no occurrence of delusion for the wise. Thus, hearing this, the Brahmin again asked the prince.


O prince, how may action arise for the wise? Even in contact with the fire of knowledge, how does action as cotton remain?


Then Hemangada, the prince, said to the Brahmin, "O Brahmin, listen, I will explain the threefold action of the wise."


For all, the actions may be unripe and ripe. Destroyed and arisen, thus there, all are destroyed by knowledge, which is superior.


The cook of actions is time, which is determined and fixed. By time, those that are mostly cooked are mentioned as ripened action.


Uncooked, unripe action may be after the arising of knowledge. Know that these are done, destroyed, by arising of knowledge, arisen from the destruction (of ignorance).


There, indeed, the ripe action that is commenced, thus it is said, stands with force like a released arrow, bearing fruit.


Rooted in that, the world appearance by precedence of knowledge, is established, even like delusion, but not delusion due to a difference in result.


It generates immediate fruit, clear to those with intoxicated knowledge, and unclear to the middling. That fruit appearance is clear for the wise.


For the highest, indeed, the immediate fruit has a clear appearance. O Brahmin, that fruit is not said to be, like the horn of a hare.


For the ignorant, the fruit of action is nourished based on the past. From past and future connection, that fruit is nourished by them.


For the wise, the connection with fruit is cut off, once connected to the self. Therefore, the fruit generated by action is not nourished for the intoxicated.


For the middling wise, that fruit is like the pain caused by a mosquito in light sleep, attaining subtlety.


For the highest wise, that fruit, even if complete, is like a burnt rope, due to the glory of established self-knowledge.


As in the course of a play, a man taking different costumes, rejoicing and lamenting again, does not attain internal change.


Thus, this one stable in knowledge, full of results, is not touched by fruits. Therefore, those fruits are like the horn of a hare.


But by the ignorant, the pure self is not perceived. Therefore, they consider the body as the self, discerning the visible as true.


By the intoxicated in knowledge, the self is known as pure consciousness. The world is seen as unreal, but even thus, due to weak practice...


Taken from previous impressions, their knowledge, considering the body as self, in between, come to the appearance of the world's reality.


Again, by the impression of knowledge, they shake off the unreal perception. Thus, mutually, the impressions of true and false knowledge...


Combined, of the intoxicated in knowledge, thus, in between, the fruit is clear. Even if the opposing impressions are equal, these are not equal, O best of sages.


By the impression of true knowledge, the other impression is obstructed. And by the impression of false knowledge, the true impression is not obstructed.


Occupied by the impression of false knowledge, one has forgotten the supreme only. Then deciding that false impression as of delusion...


Shaking off the false impression, one attains the true. Then the true impression is not obstructed ever, O best of Brahmins.


For the middling, forgetfulness is not there, nor false knowledge. For the non-forgetter, by desire, the false knowledge sometimes may arise.


This state of the accomplished is said of the aspirant, it is said, listen: as much as one is focused on that, so non-forgetfulness is elevated.


For the complete accomplished one, forgetfulness of that is not; false knowledge is removed by effort. For the highest, again, O Brahmin, either in samadhi and worldly transactions...


There is not even a little difference where non-forgetfulness (of that state) is always. For the middling, who is focused on samadhi, his non-forgetfulness is established.


It may be slightly faded and may be situated in the ground of false knowledge, O best of sages. Even the highest, due to free will or by destiny...


Even focused on samadhi, his forgetfulness may arise if negligent indeed. Actually, listen, O best of sages, about the middling and the highest of the wise.


There is indeed no action at all because they have attained completeness. Beyond the self of consciousness, they see nothing.


How can any residue of action remain, because all is turned to ashes by the fire of consciousness? Therefore, nothing remains of theirs.


Like a magic show, the actions are seen only by others. Listen, O Brahmin, I will briefly explain the secret to you.


The vision of the wise is said to be like that of Shiva. There is not even the slightest difference; this is the truth without a doubt.


Therefore, no action follows the wise. Thus, hearing this, Vasuman, as explained by Hemangada...


Free from all doubts, with a clear mind of knowledge, honored by princes and others, he returned to his place.


Having reached their city, the two princes also then lived further, thus hearing, Rama again asked the sage, Atri's son.


This knowledge indeed heard, O guru, emanating from your mouth, has destroyed my doubt and made known that great state.


The self, pervaded by consciousness, shines everywhere. Even so, all was said by you from the beginning.


Briefly, again, tell the most essential knowledge, as long as it is to be retained by me, O guru, with all my heart.


Thus asked by Rama, again, Atri's son said, "Listen, O Rama, I will explain the most essential again."


Which consciousness, the supreme goddess, complete, filled with the sense of 'I', that supreme, always known as the māyā power, from her greatness...


The world indeed manifests from the unique creator. Like a reflection in a mirror, listen to that method in order.


That supreme consciousness, complete, expanded with the complete sense of 'I', by the power of freedom, shines in its own form in two ways.


There, even in one part, when the sense of 'I' is manifested incompletely, then the second part is separated from that sense of 'I'.


That view became the external unmanifest, indeed, O descendant of Bhrigu. But the one associated with incomplete sense of 'I', this is said to be Sadashiva.


He, seeing that unmanifest part as different  even from himself, "I am this," thus always knowing by intent on contemplating with non-difference.


He indeed, again, by freedom, desiring to create the various worlds, occupied the unmanifest body of the self as "I".


Thus, so intent on contemplating, the lord manifested. Occupied the unmanifest identification, indeed the lord.


He became threefold, in the forms of Rudra, Hari, and Brahma, manifesting the vast aggregation of the seer and the seen.


Various forms became established in those forms. Many forms of Hari also became intent on destruction.


Numerous forms of Rudra thus became. This world order, thus, the world essence, is like the reflection in a mirror.


It shines only, O Rama, not anything born/appears. The supreme consciousness, indeed always in the form of complete 'I'.


Established, also numerous, enveloped in the complete sense of 'I'. As you, O Rama, filled with the sense of 'I' in all bodies.


Different eyes and other senses of 'I', also engaged in various actions. Thus indeed, the supreme consciousness rests in the complete 'I', everywhere.


From Sadashiva onwards to a blade of grass, even resting in the incomplete sense of 'I', truly, she indeed is the supreme consciousness, shining thus.


The form of bodily 'I', you, by yourself, are incapable of grasping form, taste, etc., but it is by attaining identity with consciousness.


You grasp everything always, thus, O lord Sadashiva, by yourself, full of non-difference with everything, from Brahma to a blade of grass.


Attaining identity within, he knows and does. Just as your form, indeed, is without difference, the basis of all being.


But also, does not know or do anything, O descendant of Bhrigu, thus indeed, the supreme consciousness is the basis of all worlds.


Not knowing or doing even the slightest difference anywhere, thus, all the world shines in her indeed.


By her freedom, manifested and like a mirror reflection, the shining of the world, all, indeed, is her reflection.


Like a mirror reflection, indeed, here you, I, and others, the seers, are indeed consisting of reflection.


In the meeting of the seen objects, pure consciousness is indeed, otherwise not affected. Like the non-connection of the mirror, with pots and others.


Just as pure mirror, may be the mere distinction is of reflections. Thus, in erasing the appearance of the seen arising from imagination...


Remaining as supreme consciousness with a non-dual nature, full of great bliss, and from the absence of the slightest sorrow.


Because it is the form of all condensed bliss and is desired by all, happiness may be the self-nature, because it is desired by all.


For the sake of which bodily existence, which is not desired by anyone, a trace of whose existence is indeed called pleasure from objects.


That (supreme consciousness) indeed shines in the loss of burden and in deep sleep. Consciousness indeed is called bliss from desirability.


The deluded do not know the self-nature of great bliss. They perceive differences by the difference of expressions.


As indeed, objects appearing in the mirror, their cause, as long as the knowledge of the mirror is there, it indeed shines as different.


When known as reflection, though appearing as before, is not considered different from the mirror, the mirror is indeed pure.


Thus, to the one who knows the truth, the world appears like this, everything is only the self, indeed, not otherwise.


As pots and others in clay, just as ornaments in gold, and images in stone, thus the world is in the self of consciousness.


The vision that the world does not exist indeed is incomplete, O descendant of Bhrigu. The determination, indeed, the opposite of it does not exist, does not accomplish too.


From the perception of the aspirant, the world clearly arising again, how can the world be dissolved by mere curse, saying it does not exist?


All is like a city of reflections, existing by the nature of a mirror. Thus, the world is declared to be one form with the consciousness-self, the truth.


This may be complete knowledge by eliminating contraction. This seer itself, attained seen (seeing seer-seen separately), by the greatness of its own glory.


As the mirror has the reflection of a city, this is the essence of scripture. There is no bondage, no liberation, no aspirant, and no means.


The unbroken non-dual consciousness power, Tripura, indeed, shining, she indeed is ignorance and knowledge, bondage and liberation, and the means.


This much indeed is to be known; nothing else exists, O descendant of Bhrigu. This has been told to you, O Rama, the process of knowledge from the beginning.


Knowing this well, a person further does not grieve anywhere. O Narada, this piece of knowledge is obtained by proper reasoning.


Heard, if it does not destroy whose delusion arising from ignorance. Even after hearing this, whose delusion exists, he may not attain peace anywhere.


That mountain-like man in the world, by this knowledge, how can he be born again? Once heard indeed, this knowledge may become firm.


In two or three ways, for the dull, knowledge may not be generated. This destroyer of the flood of sins, heard, is considered the giver of knowledge.


Written words, these are destroyer of fault perception, revered, purifier of the mind, destroyer of delusion, this should always be practiced.


Whose form is all-soul-prevading, clearly understood by consideration, liberation is attained. Otherwise, it may be bondage. She indeed is Tripura, hrim.
